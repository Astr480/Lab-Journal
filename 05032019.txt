Notes for 05/03/2019:

Today was, admittedly, rather unproductive. The 
virtual machine I work on required substantial updates - 
as Ubuntu 19 was just released. I also had to update 
my VirtualBox installation and rebuild the VirtualBox 
guest utilities. The good news is that nothing 
spontaneously combusted! The bad news is that I spent 
the entire class downloading an entire operating system 
through a 600 kb/s virtual connection.

I was witting next to a member of my team for the CCD 
project, and he made good progress analyzing and 
visualizing the data. He recommended a Python package 
called Glob for importing all of the FITS data we 
collected. Initial results from analysis look 
very promising.

We'll see how my own work goes.

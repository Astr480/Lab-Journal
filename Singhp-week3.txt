Monday

In class we started by turning in an assignment. We talked about project ideas and deadlines.
I am not sure exactly what I want to do my project on yet.

Wednesday

Giving more thought to ideas, ultimately have to decide on a project. Narrowed it down to a few choices. Homework was assigned on FITS files and examining them. I downloaded cal.tar.gz and started
the worksheet.

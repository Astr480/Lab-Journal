4/1/19 - Day one

ARCSTAT (optical, .5m, apache point) 

June 7  - final project
Proposal due in 3 weeks

rc or bash_profile file modify the path your computer is using (e.g. set up shortcuts, add in scripting, set defaults, and create commands) - these are configuration files. 
- watch out for conflicting commands

Keep a list of command shortcuts

run: jupyter notebook &
- This will run the command in the background (e.g. get your command line back)

view fits files:
- DS9
- QView

Vignette- design of an instrument such that the light path at the edges is being cut off. This cuts the area of view and makes the image bright in the center and dim in the center. 

Day two - 4/3/19

How does SSH effect my access with others?

Day three - 4/5/19 

The SSH shouldn’t effect the access

Historically the motors on our telescopes haven’t been good enough to look directly at an obj -> we needed finding charts 
- Jskycalc: Tracks motion of the sky, is a GUI from 1994…
- astroplan - astrapy powered, has much of Jskycalc but accessed from python

NED - extragalactic DB/catalogues 
Simbad - stellar version
- Great place to find other catalogues
- & you know, objects too.

When planning
- air was: Sp way of saying “how much atmosphere is between me and my object”  — want to target airmass is ~.5 — least directly above & most 
- The Moon: What the moon phase is? When does it rise and set? Moon is a reflected stellar spectrum and it impedes observation. You may need to make your observation earlier and later.
- Never have night - Sun never falls 18 deg lat 
- When is it dark? How long is night where you’re observing?
- Nautical twilight used to calibrate CCD and observe the characteristics of the CCD 

* wiki ain’t good place to get RA and DEC

Day four - 4/8/19

Find more DB’s on:
Nasa Heasarc:
https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/archive.html

Cocalc sucks, so do the astroconda people. Meredith is a coding badass and we modified my conda config file! Which was extremely awesome to watch Meredith do.

Begin navigating the sky. Already got the DB. Feels good!

Day five - 4/10/19

Don’t use for loops use masks. Be a good python. But still use them cause stuff can suck. 

On this day we have imaged a black hole. It looks like a donut. I hope there’s a big cup of jet black coffee at its center (which its spewing out of its jets!). It has also put, what I imagine to be, some population of theoretical physicists out of work as gravity is just gravity (as we’ve described it).  

Navigating the sky is looking to be more of a pain than I thought.

Day six - 4/12/19 

Everything is broken. I should drop out. Navigating the sky sucks. Pandas sucks. Astropy sucks. (But really its super great just frustrating….)

Meredith gave us these tasty snippets:

replace the spaces in the RA and DEC with a colon 
- coords_str = quasars['ra'].str.strip().str.replace(' ',':')+' '+quasars['dec'].str.strip().str.replace(' ',':')
 

If pandas just keeps a bunch of spaces in the column names:
- quasars.columns = [c.strip() for c in quasars.columns]

A for loop says: for x, y, x in whatever do everything that comes before the ‘for’

Thanks Meredith!!!!

Day seven - 4/15/19

Arcstat dates: april 29-may 6 & may 8-11
https://www.apo.nmsu.edu/Telescopes/ARCSAT/index.html

The proposal:
* How many days, how long? You gotta be there — it is possible to set up remote

Reading science:
* abstract and conclusion first
* read multiple times
* Summarize the paper when done

Poke your topic around on:
ARAA - https://www.annualreviews.org/journal/astro

Make multiple arrays into a data frame:

My Project?:
* Optical survey of Local Group to identify HII star forming regions

Day eight - 4/17/20

This first bib entry:

NGC database:

Day nine - 4/19/20

What do you observe:
- accretion disks
- Galaxies and their properties/dynamics
- Exoplanet transit
- Planetary nebula: Tells a lot about the original star —> multiple star systems and how they interfere with our thought of the single star evolution we think of with the HR Diagram
- HR diagrams: Look at the population (composed of 3 broadband colors) if stars are not at the same color point they are probably at different points in their lives/ different properties

CCD - turns photon in to 1’s and 0’s  when  a photon creates an electron registering as a 1

R= lambda/ D
This tells you about the use of the bandpasses as wavelength increases the precision is either optimal or suffers in different bandpasses. 

- Look at ARCSTAT filters 
- What is your object emitting?

Differential Photometry: Comparison to a star of *unknown* star e.g. not listed info for it.

Day 16:

Characterizing CCDs
full well: max number of electrons per pixel
  photon transfer curve
system gain: electrons/DN
  PTC
read noise: voltage uncertainty
  stdev of bias, must use clean part of chip
charge transfer efficiency: usually 0.99999995+
  use an Fe55 x-ray source
dark current: thermal charge
  dark frames
quantum efficiency: how well a pixel handles light
  flats with calibrated source

photon transfer curves
  signal vs noise (both units DN)

types of saturation
  full well: governed by pixels
  ADU: max output based on number of bits

noise
  read noise: S/N ~S
  shot/photon noise: S/N ~sqrt(S)

bias subtraction
  don't want negative values (bit allocation)
  function of readout, not time, so we subtract it

flat fields are wavelength dependent
  divide signal by flat fields

dark fields
  can show large scale pattern noise

Day 17:

Data Reduction

every night, you should take flats, darks, and biases

full well for arcsat 65000

Day 18:

HCG (Hickson Compact Group)
  groups of galaxies
  HCG 79 Seyfert's Sextet

quad: quad readout mode -- 4 amplifiers

may choose to put object offcenter to keep all in one amplifier

cosmic rays: high energy particles crashing through CCD
  may be a streak if hitting at an angle

dual image spectrograph

not many sky emission lines in optical, most in IR

donut shape (dark middle light ring) means star out of focus

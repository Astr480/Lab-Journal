Test Lab Journal.
Thank you again for extending this assignment. I just got back from my trip.

It took me a bit of time to relearn how to use python for astronomical analysis, but I was  able to slowly figure things out again, thanks to looking at old assignments from Astro 300 with Toby. Missing class on Friday set me back a little, and I was unable to finish the in-class assignment observing M31.

I was not feeling well, so I was unable to make it to class. My partner Brandon and I were working on the project, but because he is out of town, it was harder to work on the project together.

Today, we are supposed to work on the group project and turn it in. My partner has the paper, and he will be out of town until the end of the weekend. We will continue working on the group project throughout the weekend using the extension.

In class, we talked about the research project proposal. Talking to classmates, I was able to get an idea of what I wanted to do for my research project. I landed on quasars. We talked a lot about them throughout upper-level Astronomy courses, and I thought they were interesting. I am still unsure of what to do with it, but I will figure this out at a later time. My partner being out of town until Sunday, we also finished up our Night Sky in-class assignment.

We worked on a work sheet that we obtained in class; the worksheet focused on FITS files. I did not get very far in this project.

Touched bases on the project proposal again. Talked about how a photon can make its way into a telescope to become a FITS file. Finished working on project proposals. After talking to Shaun, we decided to take on the group project together.

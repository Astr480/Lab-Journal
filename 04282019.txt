Notes for 04/28/2019:

Today I was quickly sectioned off into a group and told 
to follow Prof. Fraser to a different room for a project. 
There was an old CCD from a defunct company in the room, 
and we were informed that we were going to characterize 
it. Navigating Windows XP was fun - a flashback to my 
childhood.

In the end we had to stay a bit overtime to get the flats 
needed for linearity testing. The main issue was finding 
the correct object to prop open the dark box the camera 
was on, such that precisely the right amount of light made 
it in. We wound up using a pencil.

The things we do in astronomy...

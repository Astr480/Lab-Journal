lab journal Week 1

Learn the basic Unix command just like in Astro 300

for example: ls, cd, pwd

Use jupyter notebook to do python

choose a text editor, I think I will just use the visual studio code

Learn how to use github
the basic idea for github is that it is a version control tool for everyone
to contribute to one project. It is amazing to see how people use it for different
things.

git add FILE
git commit -m "commet"
git push
git pull

pull request: merge your file to the main repository that allow all people can contribute
to the same project

different tool that we can use:

SIMBAD, NED, astroplan

use astroplan to do obervation
Initiate a new oberver, can have many method that we can use

concept:
airmass, the moon immpedes obs, astronomical twilight

some practice about how to use astroplan.

Need to think about some possible research project!

learn how to use pull request feature !

Week 2

class 1
Finishing last week's assingment about how you can use different method to
do the same thing

Seasonal Obserbability can be dome by just looking at the RA from the vernal equnoix
then we need the sun in the opposite side

Or we can just see it in jSkyCalc

Length of the night can be just done in astroplan

class 2

Keep working on the planning observation

we choose to do binary star they are not that birght

we first pull all the data from the internet then try to see if it is visiable
in each night of our observation window

Obserbability table can be useful but we can only get if it is obserbable or not
we need more data related to it like airmass and location

class 3 

Still working on the planning obervation

We did the first part by test each day for wheather it is visiable or not 
from the astroplan 
if it is visiable more than 10 night then, we ramdom choose 10 of them to contiune

Moon is hard to work with, we try to plot the airmass for all the 10 object that works

but then we would not know how the moon illumination effect the obervation

Try to use some other tools to get this done. 

Week 3

Finally we are working on the project and try to come up with a project proposal

The resason that I love physic and astromy are mostly from science fiction, as the result "three body problem"
is one of my favourite novel.

I am thnk about doing something about the exo planet and triple star system

triple star system might just be too rare, I think I will add binary star too

For a planet to be habitable, it need to have the right temperture and stable orbit for life to form
also magnetic field, tidal effect, etc....

Working on the Fits file, it is a very interesting way to store image I only work with it on Astr 300
it directly record the data from the ccd and have some other feature can be add to the file encodeing

We talked about some basic idea about how to do observation. Including how a photon travel from a star to the fit file

Some basic tool and method that we can use to do observation, for example imaging and spectroscopy

Just noticed that fit file can also store spectroscopy data, it look nothing like a real picture

Filters: different type, U, R, I ...... each filter could need different treatment in terms of exposure time

differential vs. absolute photometry: need to do this becuase sometimes it is hard to find a reference star

Week 4
 Class 1

 distruibution difference between gaussis and poisson
 photon distruibute like poisson

 charge transfer: loss charge between transfer
 readout: readout from each pixel then transfer them to the next pixel, finally move all of them to the last roll

 QE comparisons

 Key feature:
    CCD are linear
    pixel can saturate
    gain is intrinsic
    Responsive in the optical
    CCD have become commercially viable

CMOS: the charge to voltage conversion are in the pixel

Noise:
    shot noise: photon arrival at the chop for any given interval is governed by the poisson distruibution
    Dark current: need to cool it, function of time , need dark which match the length of the time of exposure
    read noise: gaussian, around bias level

CLASS 2

    we did the experiment of spectroscopy, where we use a very simple spectroscopy device to look at different elements
    There are H that we can clearly see the three bright balmer series emission line. 

    Also many other elements for us to explore, the scope spectroscopy can get a better view of the spectrom line than the
    palastic one. 

    some line are repeated in different elements, I guess it is becuase they all have the same electron orbit energy which result
    in emmit the same frequence line

    We also did the filter experiment, which is simple, different filter are only allow certain band of frequence to be through
    THe interesting one is the UV filter which block most of the sunlight, but when you see a sunglasses from the UV filter,
    you see the sunglasses become transparent

CLASS 3
    we talked about some method to manipulate the data you can find from the catalog. Like add or delete some rows or coloumn
    Also, we looked about how to use fits file to draw in the python

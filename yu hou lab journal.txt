lab journal Week 1

Learn the basic Unix command just like in Astro 300

for example: ls, cd, pwd

Use jupyter notebook to do python

choose a text editor, I think I will just use the visual studio code

Learn how to use github
the basic idea for github is that it is a version control tool for everyone
to contribute to one project. It is amazing to see how people use it for different
things.

git add FILE
git commit -m "commet"
git push
git pull

pull request: merge your file to the main repository that allow all people can contribute
to the same project

different tool that we can use:

SIMBAD, NED, astroplan

use astroplan to do obervation
Initiate a new oberver, can have many method that we can use

concept:
airmass, the moon immpedes obs, astronomical twilight

some practice about how to use astroplan.

Need to think about some possible research project!

learn how to use pull request feature !

Week 2

class 1
Finishing last week's assingment about how you can use different method to
do the same thing

Seasonal Obserbability can be dome by just looking at the RA from the vernal equnoix
then we need the sun in the opposite side

Or we can just see it in jSkyCalc

Length of the night can be just done in astroplan

class 2

Keep working on the planning observation

we choose to do binary star they are not that birght

we first pull all the data from the internet then try to see if it is visiable
in each night of our observation window

Obserbability table can be useful but we can only get if it is obserbable or not
we need more data related to it like airmass and location

class 3 

Still working on the planning obervation

We did the first part by test each day for wheather it is visiable or not 
from the astroplan 
if it is visiable more than 10 night then, we ramdom choose 10 of them to contiune

Moon is hard to work with, we try to plot the airmass for all the 10 object that works

but then we would not know how the moon illumination effect the obervation

Try to use some other tools to get this done.

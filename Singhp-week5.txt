Monday

Looked at the CCD lab, read it all. Doesn't seem too bad but didn't
get to collect data yet. I am excited to see how this will work, and how
the flats will look.

Wednesday

Our group got to go the room to collect data. We pointed the CCD
to the ceiling, after failing to get a decent image due to its own 
shadow. After taking images at varying exposure times, we uploaded
our data to Google Drive.

Friday
Processing CCD data, gain is negative and small. Wrong but fine. Probably continue
working on the lab throughout the weekend and see where I end up.
note-changing the region still doesn't have an effect on the gain but
professor says its ok.

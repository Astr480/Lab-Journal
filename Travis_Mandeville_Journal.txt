Week 1:
General review of syllabus and class expectations.

Worked briefly with DS9 in looking at an image of M31. Discussed "vignetting" and is source being the way the actual instrument was constructed. This is something that can be overcome and is not necessarily unavoidable. 

Completed a review of Github. Learned how to use it more completely (i.e. having an account and not using it). Can now setup a remote repository on my computer and how to collaborate with files on other contributor's machines. Conflicts seem like something I'm going to be often at odds with. Completed most of the partner activity with Michael.

Couldn't figure out how to "Fork" the 480/Lab-Journal, Michael showed me how to do that on top of activating the upstream function.

Week 2:
Began working with JSkyCalc... its impossible.

JSkyCalc breakthrough courtesy of Prof. Tuttle. In order to change the input values in a way that will result in JSkyCalc actually taking hose directions, you must hit enter instead of just tabbing out of the field. An additional note is that in order to select mulitple items in the object list, you first have to open the airmass from the main screen. Once the dedicated oject list box comes up you should then be free to select any single or multiple items. Doing this out of order will result in scrolling through the object list but not being able to select more than one. Also, once you have the list loaded you can simply type in the name of the object your interested in and the specifics will auto-fil. Not a big deal for this assignment (20 objects), but should prove incredibly valuable if I'm ever working with a significantly larger object list. 

Was able to complete most of the NightSky assignment with Michael. JSkyCalc is super usful once you know how to navigate the things that make JSkyCalc... "special" as Prof. Tuttle so generously puts it. One thing to note is that ploting the airmasses of multiple objects with similar RA and Dec, is so redundant that it eventually make the entirety of the plot unreadable. Last, JSkyCalc proficiency note. The moon despite my assumptions is not on the "Planets" button. I know its not a planet but, we seem to grant special privilages to items we strongly depend on (ex. Sun not star, moon not satallite, etc.). This information is on the Seasonal Observatbility table, and notes the phase of the moon (New, Full) for given dates. 

Github progress was a lie!!! I mistakenly cloned the general Astr480/NighSky repo instead of forking it to a repository and then cloning it. Couldn't figure out how to un-clone a link to the repo. So, I decided to just delete the directory on my machine and move all the material needed to submit the assignment into a brand new directory start from scratch. 

===============================================================================
Week 3:
Worked heavily with DS9 looking at FITS files. Some "special" traits of DS9, if you need to create a region, you have to select Edit on the main menu, then Region below than, then you can create a region. Getting information is the first step required to get to other useful information such as Statistics and Histograms among other things. Additionally, this is purely anecdotal, but it seems when selecting the scale for viewing the image, if you are viewing somethig that is decently bright, z-scale seems to be a better setting. Conversely, a low light image seems to be better using the min/max scale. 

Worked on my project proposal. As a result I was forced to use JSkyCalc, and as expected it attempted to frustrate me to the point of snapping my laptop in half. It exentually cooperated and I used it to verify what objects I had identified as Type I Cepheid, will be observable from APO during our observing window. Unfortunately, only 2 of my objects will be viewed at an airmass of less than 1.5. The others are still up and observable, but with an airmass of less than 2. I don't forsee this being a tremendous setback as I am primarily concerned with the period of the luminosity variations. I don't need the optimal airmass to get this information on each star. 

Continued working on the FITS file assignment using DS9. Note: The variability in our flat field is suprisingly "unflat". Also, DS9 had a small moment of specialness that caused the Overscan area on the image, which should not be fractional, to be... fractional. Never underestimate the power of restarting the program as that was the only action that would correct whatever issue was causing this error. For finding information having to do with everything from the Telescope, Observatory, Filter, RA & Dec, even the temperature of the detector during the observation. 

===============================================================================
Week 4:

Worked on the spectra activity. While I was not able to complete it entirely, I did get most of the way through it. The most interesting part by far was using the small spectroscope. Learning how to change the aperature and resolution was incredibly cool. 

I was able to finish the spectra activity on Wednesday. With the remaining time I was able to complete my observing time request for my research project. I needed to double check the magnitudes associated with each of my targets to ensure that not only would they have a usable Apparent Mag, but also the the stars in question would not saturate the detector. I concluded that with the exception of Polaris, most of them should not be an issue. All of my objects will be available between 11:00PM and 1:00AM with airmasses around 1.8 for all objects. This is not necessarily optimal, bt for purposes of my project, this is probably not the end of the world. 

On Friday we got a crash course in reading in data from Meredith (resident Pandas professional). This is very useful for Werk Squad, as we are begining to take apart and analyze all of our identifications, requiring all of the Pandas.  While digesting all of the knowledge presented the most relevant item to someone as 'green' as myself is: help(command). 

Notes:
Isolate a particular column: df['Header'] single column or multiple
Convert value to string:     for col in ['Header_1', 'Header_2', , ]
			     df.astype(str).str.strip()
			     pd.to_numeric(df)  

Built-in plotting:	     df.plot.scatter('Header_1', c='Header_2')

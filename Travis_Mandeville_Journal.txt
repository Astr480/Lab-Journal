Week 1:
General review of syllabus and class expectations.

Worked briefly with DS9 in looking at an image of M31. Discussed "vignetting" and is source being the way the actual instrument was constructed. This is something that can be overcome and is not necessarily unavoidable. 

Completed a review of Github. Learned how to use it more completely (i.e. having an account and not using it). Can now setup a remote repository on my computer and how to collaborate with files on other contributor's machines. Conflicts seem like something I'm going to be often at odds with. Completed most of the partner activity with Michael.

Couldn't figure out how to "Fork" the 480/Lab-Journal, Michael showed me how to do that on top of activating the upstream function.

Week 2:
Began working with JSkyCalc... its impossible.

JSkyCalc breakthrough courtesy of Prof. Tuttle. In order to change the input values in a way that will result in JSkyCalc actually taking hose directions, you must hit enter instead of just tabbing out of the field. An additional note is that in order to select mulitple items in the object list, you first have to open the airmass from the main screen. Once the dedicated oject list box comes up you should then be free to select any single or multiple items. Doing this out of order will result in scrolling through the object list but not being able to select more than one. Also, once you have the list loaded you can simply type in the name of the object your interested in and the specifics will auto-fil. Not a big deal for this assignment (20 objects), but should prove incredibly valuable if I'm ever working with a significantly larger object list. 

Was able to complete most of the NightSky assignment with Michael. JSkyCalc is super usful once you know how to navigate the things that make JSkyCalc... "special" as Prof. Tuttle so generously puts it. One thing to note is that ploting the airmasses of multiple objects with similar RA and Dec, is so redundant that it eventually make the entirety of the plot unreadable. Last, JSkyCalc proficiency note. The moon despite my assumptions is not on the "Planets" button. I know its not a planet but, we seem to grant special privilages to items we strongly depend on (ex. Sun not star, moon not satallite, etc.). This information is on the Seasonal Observatbility table, and notes the phase of the moon (New, Full) for given dates. 

Github progress was a lie!!! I mistakenly cloned the general Astr480/NighSky repo instead of forking it to a repository and then cloning it. Couldn't figure out how to un-clone a link to the repo. So, I decided to just delete the directory on my machine and move all the material needed to submit the assignment into a brand new directory start from scratch.

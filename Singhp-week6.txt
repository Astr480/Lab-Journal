Monday

Looked at ways to reduce data, stuff was kinda confusing but
I think I get it.

Wednesday

SSH into some archive and downloaded a ton of data.
Visually inspected everything to make sure its okay and
made an excel file to keep log.

Friday

Worked more on reduction and started getting into the worksheet
that is due soon. Need to figure out some more things on the CCD
worksheet as well, gonna be a long weeekend.

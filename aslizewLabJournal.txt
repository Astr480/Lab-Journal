Day 1 and 2
-reviewed basic coding, vocab, for directories, using terminals, unix
-W credit!!!! 10 pages of writing plus graphs etc, plus extra drafts due
-Observing Project-- only optical
-invisible files: ls -A or -a or *.
-rc or profile, configuration files
-github is scary
-VERSION CONTROL, can make comments, connect w people
-Merging, conflicts (too conflicting?)

Day 3:
-Simbad: stellar catalogue
-NED:nasa/ipac extragalactic database
-good for objects, finding other catalogue
-Jskycalc:pln and optimize observing (when/where/how long objects in sky, 1994)
-hard way is Astropy, AstroPLAN dep on astropy but is separate
-iobserve is 30 bucks
-Airmass: atmosphere. how much in the way.  LEAST = STRAIGHT AHEAD, 1.5 or lower
-The Moon impedes obs, its bright (reflected stellar spectra, not good in optical)
PROJECT CONSIDERATIONS: Moon time
-arcsat sassy about nautical Twilight timing, vs astronomical twilight
ACTIVITY:FROM APO, M31, what season is best, on April 16, how many observing hours,
on Dec 31, is the moon in the way/ what is the moons phase, and how many hours can observe on Dec 31

Day 4:
-Partner PROJECT- Navigating the Night Sky with LEXIEEEEEEEEE
-Object type: exoplanets
-Database: NASA
-'&'' for Jupyter notebook leaving kernel open

Day 5:
-continue on partner PROJECT
is observing length corrected? NO, must make array for every day for correct total time
-will continue on friday, where its due, As well as lab journal for week 2 (updated)

Day 6:
-Finished up the partner project,
-I figured out how to do the correct observing length!!!! I had to write out each day but
the astropy time package is super cool.

Day 7:
-Oliver's 481 talk :D
-RESEARCH PROPOSALS~~~~~~~~~~ DUE friday
-end goal= 15 page paper decribing work (observations and analysis done)
-some description (not every command), plots, why sources, also submitting code,
-teams but separate codes and writeups
-scientific paper - introduction, what and why, referenes in intro, tell us something of obects and methods to study,
Data section, observation stuff, weather etc of the Night
-analysis, results, and conclusions (regular flow)
-grading rubric will be on canvas, checklist with points
-May 20 first draft and peer review and tuttle review,
-seconds draft May 29, be much done, some analysis and data spots missing but bulk of outline, sections, references, writing etc done
-June 3- W credit third draft, prose writing,
-measuring dust lanes in spirals, photometry and cmds in clusters, multiple band analysis of local galaxies
-ARCSAT stuffs
-get used to research, try something doable (not a noble prize)
-remote observing, april 29-may 6, may 8-may 11
-Note if using arcsat, a-wing telescope, archive, etc in proposal!!! (how getting data)
-evening arcsat orientation  if many groups, might set people up (have whole nighttime)
-scientific papers, abstracts and conclusions then plots and tables, summary paragraph ideal and what conclusions / main points
-Annual reviews, interesting topics/ project ideas, change w time but general enough to give osme idea of a field, and references and foundations

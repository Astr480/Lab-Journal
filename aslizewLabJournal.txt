Day 1 and 2

-W credit!!!! 10 pages of writing plus graphs etc, plus extra drafts due
-Observing Project-- only optical
-invisible files: ls -A or -a or *.
-rc or profile, configuration files
-github is scary
-VERSION CONTROL, can make comments, connect w people
-Merging, conflicts (too conflicting?)

Day 3:
-Simbad: stellar catalogue
-NED:nasa/ipac extragalactic database
-good for objects, finding other catalogue
-Jskycalc:pln and optimize observing (when/where/how long objects in sky, 1994)
-hard way is Astropy, AstroPLAN dep on astropy but is separate
-iobserve is 30 bucks
-Airmass: atmosphere. how much in the way.  LEAST = STRAIGHT AHEAD, 1.5 or lower
-The Moon impedes obs, its bright (reflected stellar spectra, not good in optical)
PROJECT CONSIDERATIONS: Moon time
-arcsat sassy about nautical Twilight timing, vs astronomical twilight
ACTIVITY:FROM APO, M31, what season is best, on April 16, how many observing hours,
on Dec 31, is the moon in the way/ what is the moons phase, and how many hours can observe on Dec 31

Day 4:
-Partner PROJECT- Navigating the Night Sky with LEXIEEEEEEEEE
-Object type: exoplanets
-Database: NASA
-'&'' for Jupyter notebook leaving kernel open

Day 5:
-continue on partner PROJECT
is observing length corrected? NO, must make array for every day for correct total time
-will continue on friday, where its due, As well as lab journal for week 2 (updated)

Day 6:
-Finished up the partner project,
-I figured out how to do the correct observing length!!!! I had to write out each day but
the astropy time package is super cool.

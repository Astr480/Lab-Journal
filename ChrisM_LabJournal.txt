Today I learned how to use github. Sort of.
I have no idea what to use for my research project. I like cosmology.
It sounds like the telescopes we have access to have limited spectroscopic abilities.

I need to have a meeting with the professor to figure out what a good project would encompass.

For the assignment of finding a catalog for finding quasars we were able to find the catalog on the NASA HEARSAR(sp?) website. The formatting needed to be fixed first so I used the FixedTarget command after I ran into issues with SkyCoord.

I made a plot to see what objects would be visible by ploting the attenuation, moon seperation, and altitude. I am trying to figure out how to factor in moon luminosty.

I used a moon phase calendar from google to check the moon phase during my time window at CTIO. 

I can still optimize the code better to sort the table by fractional observation time in order to rank objects for different observation times.

Potential projexts:
Is there galaxy rotational axis correlation: Requires a catalog with spectra to fit rotation curves. Correlate with galaxy classification, "Axis ratio", and density of galaxies in surrounding space. SDSS galaxy environment information catalog. https://www.sdss.org/dr15/data_access/value-added-catalogs/

I updated my notes for my project and have opened six papers and saved them to my Zotero.

It is difficult to work on this project only from the astrolab. I should figure out how to work on this from home.

Today I learned how to use github. Sort of.
I have no idea what to use for my research project. I like cosmology.
It sounds like the telescopes we have access to have limited spectroscopic abilities.

I need to have a meeting with the professor to figure out what a good project would encompass.

For the assignment of finding a catalog for finding quasars we were able to find the catalog on the NASA HEARSAR(sp?) website. The formatting needed to be fixed first so I used the FixedTarget command after I ran into issues with SkyCoord.

I made a plot to see what objects would be visible by ploting the attenuation, moon seperation, and altitude. I am trying to figure out how to factor in moon luminosty.

I used a moon phase calendar from google to check the moon phase during my time window at CTIO. 

I can still optimize the code better to sort the table by fractional observation time in order to rank objects for different observation times.

Potential projexts:
Is there galaxy rotational axis correlation: Requires a catalog with spectra to fit rotation curves. Correlate with galaxy classification, "Axis ratio", and density of galaxies in surrounding space. SDSS galaxy environment information catalog. https://www.sdss.org/dr15/data_access/value-added-catalogs/

I updated my notes for my project and have opened six papers and saved them to my Zotero.

It is difficult to work on this project only from the astrolab. I should figure out how to work on this from home.

Vignetting: dark regions at edges due to scattering

Bias/Overscan: give information about electronics. Might have something to do with amplifiers.

A large enough number of samples will cause many types of distrobutions (poisson included) into gaussian distributions.

Serial register/horizontal CCD: bottom row of CCD array. Gets pushed right to a single cell.

Dark current = thermal noise

quantum efficiency is bad for ~<300nm

n_{tot}=sqrt{(n_{phot})^2+(n_{dark})^2+(n_{read})^2+(n_{bias})^2}

noise=sqrt{signal}

want to subtract dark current from scan by exposing for same amount of time.

bias is read noise?

today we are beginning a characterization lab report on CCDs. Refer to the back of the packet for grading.

Compare measurements with vendor information.

Gain: #electrons/ADU. But it is somehow inversely related to the gain of the amplifier?

Must take two bias frames and two flatfield exposures to get difference images

get ___ for single files and mget ___* for all files that begin with the same starting part.

We are working on a new Reducing Imaging Data using Bias, Flats, Darks, and Images.

Thus far I have been using ds9 to collect data for the processes. I will probably have to come in over the weekend because my personal research is pressing and I have a group meeting presentation coming up tomorrow. Yay 19 credits...

PSF - point spread function. Must make sure that we are subtracting background from our image to ensure our signal is all from our object

There are many different sources that can be giving different point spread functions as well as varying the background at all background wavelengths.

To find the background you can point at a "dark" area of sky and try to characterize the background.

Masking nearby objects might make sense if the point spread function is an issue.

Does is make sense to define the center of the object as its peak.

Have to deal with other objects that may not be spatially resolvable as well as other galaxies with foreground stars.

When using data for Aperature photomotry it is best to use point sources.

Using the gaussian fits in DAOStarFinder it seems to REALLY like some of my brightest stars. It tends to fit more gaussians to my brightest stars and I don't see any parameters to adjust this.

adjusting the FWHM to be larger seems to have helped but may have just better stacked the same gaussians. Tough to say.

This is a lot of work for this week. Mary gates is tomorrow and I can't come to class and we have the rough draft of our paper due Monday. I think the Reducing Imaging Data would have been fine if it was accompanied by a jupyter notebook for the apperature and PSF portions. Maybe I'm just really bad at coding though.

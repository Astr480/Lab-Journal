Today I learned how to use github. Sort of.
I have no idea what to use for my research project. I like cosmology.
It sounds like the telescopes we have access to have limited spectroscopic abilities.

I need to have a meeting with the professor to figure out what a good project would encompass.

For the assignment of finding a catalog for finding quasars we were able to find the catalog on the NASA HEARSAR(sp?) website. The formatting needed to be fixed first so I used the FixedTarget command after I ran into issues with SkyCoord.

I made a plot to see what objects would be visible by ploting the attenuation, moon seperation, and altitude. I am trying to figure out how to factor in moon luminosty.

I used a moon phase calendar from google to check the moon phase during my time window at CTIO. 

I can still optimize the code better to sort the table by fractional observation time in order to rank objects for different observation times.


Is there galaxy rotational axis correlation: Requires a catalog with spectra to fit rotation curves. Correlate with galaxy classification, "Axis ratio", and density of galaxies in surrounding space. SDSS galaxy environment information catalog. https://www.sdss.org/dr15/data_access/value-added-catalogs/

I updated my notes for my project and have opened six papers and saved them to my Zotero.

It is difficult to work on this project only from the astrolab. I should figure out how to work on this from home.

Vignetting: dark regions at edges due to scattering

Bias/Overscan: give information about electronics. Might have something to do with amplifiers.

A large enough number of samples will cause many types of distrobutions (poisson included) into gaussian distributions.

Serial register/horizontal CCD: bottom row of CCD array. Gets pushed right to a single cell.

Dark current = thermal noise

quantum efficiency is bad for ~<300nm

n_{tot}=sqrt{(n_{phot})^2+(n_{dark})^2+(n_{read})^2+(n_{bias})^2}

noise=sqrt{signal}

want to subtract dark current from scan by exposing for same amount of time.

bias is read noise?

We looked at spectra and learned about astropy tables and how to make them managable as well as pandas.

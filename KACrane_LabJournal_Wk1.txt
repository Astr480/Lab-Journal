Day 1:

(commandline practice)

vim or emacs?

$ command &
runs command in background (e.g. $ jupyter notebook &)

need to Fork repository when I get access

what's the difference between circular and rectangular vignetting?

Day 2:

updating repository
git add FILE
git commit -m "NOTES"
git push origin master

conflicts when collaborator (or self) has pushed without other pulling repository
fixed by going through and merging changes

Day 3:

night sky observation tools
SIMBAD -- stars
NED    -- galaxies

use multiple tools for crosschecking

astropy/astroplan can be used for sky predicting

things that impede observations
-airmass
-moon (can be cheated by observing in moon-dark bands)
-twilights

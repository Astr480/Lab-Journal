Lab Journal: Week 9

5/27/19
- Memorial Day (no class). Worked primarily on the SDSS Surveys Lab due next Friday, as well as prepare (open) my resources for writing the final paper and 
working on homework from my other classes. 

5/29/19
- Stayed home from school to work on all the work I had pile up - SDSS Surveys Lab, and weekly homework from my other two classes (due Friday). 
- I didn't turn in a 2nd draft, both due to work pileup and personal issues. 

5/31/19
- Made this lab journal.
- Finished up my SDSS Surveys Lab and converted to PDF. Printed it out just in case. 
- In class, we wrapped up the SDSS Surveys Lab. I already finished it before class, including the matching, but before turning it in at the end of class I reviewed
and revised the question on detecting binary stars in CMDs. I initially said 'I don't know', but after Sarah gave us hints in class I pondered the question and wrote
a more definitive answer. 
- We received the homework sheet related to machine learning, and I read it to get a sense of exactly what it is about. 
- I also began work on the homework sheet after reading briefly about machine learning on the Web.

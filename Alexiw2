  BLACK HOLE DAY! We started looking at the black hole image released today and then discussed sacrificing a chicken to get our data. 
  Weird day tbh. Megan and I worked with our code, we ran into issues with the RA and DEC(apparently our data is ancient oops) but we got
  it to work out (I hope). Due to these issues, our code is on Megan's computer and I was working with her to write the code together.
  I looked at her screen and we tried different suggestions in our code. We spent most of the class troubleshooting

  This day's entry was deleted somehow, but I worked with troubleshooting my code and uploading an image of what it should look 
  like.

  For this research paper, I want to use ARCSAT to observe nearby galaxies and look for star formation. I will use the optical and H-alpha
  capabilities from the telescope and compare spiral and elliptical galaxies!

  Today we worked with fits stuff and my windows device could not open the files correctly. In addition to that issue, I had a sort of 
  anxiety episode so I did my best to focus despite feeling anxious, lightheaded, and shaky. Megan allowed me to work with her, and this was OK'd by Meredith.

Joseph Breneman Journal week 7

Monday (5/13/19):
*We spent time today talking about photometry, and further reductions of the data.
*I underestimated the overscan reducing procedure. Ccdproc has some rabbit hole aspects to it that I discovered, unfortunately.
*Trying to concentrate is sometimes hard 100% of the time.
*I need to find some betgter info on creating light curves for my research project that can be compared to the main paper that I am referring to with respect to the variable period of my observed star.
*It was a long weekend getting the CCD paper done but I have to say I learned a great deal about CCD's

Wednesday (5/15/19):
*Today I really got quite a bit done on the Data reduction lab. I downloaded all of my images, and got them to load correctly using the ccdproc.
*Downloaded the photutils package and performed the test to make sure it was working properly.
*Professor Tuttle gave us a fits image to use for the photometry part of the lab.
*This week is turning out to be a productive week thus far.
*Owls, definitely owls.

Friday (5/17/19):
*Today we talked about the research paper, Professor Tuttle had some good insights to share, specifically about making good references.
*Physics undergrad symposium is today, don't forget to go to mary gates.
*Got to see the planet-arium today for the first time. It was nice to look at stars and not worry about how I'm going to try and reduce them to data.
*Have a nice weekend.

Monday
I was still a little sick today, so i didnt attend class but I used ds9 to complete the writing 
assignment to the best of my ability. I think I missed out on the day of hardware.

Wednesday
Came to class today and was confused on the day of hardware. People gave me conflicting information on what to do,
but I thought it was really fun to see all the different color spectra.

Friday
I did a little research and started my rough draft. This is gonna take a lot of time I can tell.
I am keeping track of my sources and will continue to add more in LaTeX.

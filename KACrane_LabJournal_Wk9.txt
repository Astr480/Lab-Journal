Day 25:

worked on SDSS data lab

hard to tell boundaries of M67
best way to reduce number of stars queried?
  used TOP n

CMDs look strange -- no clear main sequence


Day 26:

inner 0.25deg stars don't make much sense to me. They don't seem meaningfully different from the rest. Maybe not dense enough on image?

how to match crossmatched stars to the input star it's matching?
  err_maj vs err_min?

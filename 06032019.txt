Notes for 06/03/2019:

Today was our introduction to machine learning. Topics covered 
included differences between supervised and unsupervised learning 
and common applications of each. We were handed some homework and 
a lab on the topic, both of which I finished after class.

The scikit-learn tutorials and exercises that we looked at were really 
well written, and I plan on solving them and posting the solutions to 
my online portfolio as I apply for jobs.

This was one of my favorite topics.

- Worked in class to ponder deeply and thoroughly about an astronomy project of interest to me. I first thought about investigating life and habitability
of planets, but I felt that a topic less biology-related might make more sense for this class. Also, I know little about biology.
- Used most of the class period to browse the articles on Annual Reviews of Astronomy & Astrophysics, and read the abstracts of articles that attracted my
attention most.
- Thought about researching high-mass stars, since I find them more interesting and easier to observe/retrieve data on than faint low-mass stars. 
- After thinking of high-mass stars I shifted to high-mass binary star systems, and then to binary star systems in general. I realized I know little about
how binary star systems form, and thought to do a project related to their formation/theories of their formation. 
- Found some resources that might help me decide on a project topic, and saved them on the proposal paper.

- The assignment 'Fits Files and Calibration Frames' was introduced, and the entire rest of the class period was spent working on the assignment.
- Downloaded the required Zip folder from Canvas for the first problem in the assignment. 
- Must uninstall WinZip. No idea why I have that installed, since it prevented me from opening the Zip file.
- Progress on the assignment was slow so far (I am not adept with computer technology) but thank goodness I have the weekend to work :)

- In further developing my project I thought of the categories and characteristics of binary star systems and thought it interesting to investigate those 
in more detail. 
- I also thought it interesting to investigate correlations between these characteristics and see if they match up with current theories of binary star formation.
- This led me to a basic overview of a project, which I wrote on the proposal sheet.
- I found a few more resources from the Web that may help me in my project, and included them on the proposal sheet. 
- Also in class, together we discussed the journey of a photon as it travels from a celestial object to an observer (data). 
- We segwayed into discussion/overview of observation of astronomical objects, including a basic review of filters, workings and limitations of observation tools, 
CCDs, and factors that interfere with observations (a LOT of factors). 

- Thought to set up my tiny amateur telescope at home later this weekend, and point it at something when the stubborn sky clears.
- I once saw Saturn. It was awesome.
- Also Jupiter and the 4 largest moons.
- I also think that, if time outside of the Fits Files assignment, this weekend I will read up on CCDs from the CCD textbook for this class, and to read up
more on astronomical observation (partly to feel more generally prepared in astronomy and also to satisfy my curiosity).

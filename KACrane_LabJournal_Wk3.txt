Day 7:

proposal needs to include how i expect to collect data (archival, telescope, ARCSAT, etc)

relation between rotation curve/mass distribution/mass?
Does the mass distribution relate to the amount of luminous matter?

Day 9:

Astronomical Observation

what are we observing?
	light curves
		eclipses
		exoplanet transits
	galaxies
		edge on vs face on
		gas
		kinematics
	planetary nebulae
		info about star that has died
		maybe some from binary/triple systems, leading to weird shapes
	color-magnitude diagrams
		info about population

balance between guiding assumptions and open-mindedness

CCD
	photon colliding with pixel creates electrons, which register as voltage

Imaging: pictures
photometry: measuring apparent magnitudes
spectroscopy: measuring different wavelengths

filters inform how exposure time must be adjusted

round objects onto square pixels

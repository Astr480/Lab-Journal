This first week was spent setting up github and getting use to it.
I reviewed some Unix commands.
I found out I could use nano as a txt editor (learned how to save and exit).
I don't really know what I am supposed to put in lab journals.
I also have no idea what I want to research or even how to figure out what I
want to research. 

Date: Monday April 8
Worked through theobserving M31 activity. I had to review astropy and figure 
out Jskycalc. 
Also found out I can get data tables from NASA, which was helpful for the
activity: Planning Observations. 

Date: Wednesday April 10
I worked on the activity Planning Observations. I had to figure out what
constraints would be relavent (airmass, distance from moon, astronomical
twilight) and how to apply them to my list of objects. I managed to get
a reasonable list of objects I can observe. Now, I just got to figure out
what to do with that list.
Also, https://www.calendar-12.com/moon_calendar/2019/march is a useful 
website for figuring out the moon phase.

Date: Friday April 12
I finished up the Planning Observation assignment. I keep forgetting how to 
clone repositories, so I am going to put the steps here:
1. Copy link from github
2. Go to the derectory you want to put it in
3. type "git clone" then paste the link
4. Hit Enter!

Anika also thought me that in jupyter notebook, highlighting a line and
hitting the quotes key will put quotes around that line. I found that
to be a handy trick.

I felt pretty proud of myself for figuring out how to get the observing
activity onto github by myself. Now I just hope my code is correct and is
actually doing what I think it is doing.

Joke of the week: What does noise does a space turkey make?

WEEK 3

Date: Monday, April 15

Today we started working on our research proposal. I still don't understand
what to do. So, after having a slight mental break down, I decided I would 
try to keep things simple. My goal for this class is to learn how to do
research and how to operate a telescope remotely. I am hoping just looking
at a few, or maybe just one in-depth, open star clusters with the ARCSAT
and getting whatever information I can the it. 

I am probably going to use this list of open clusters:
http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/cats/B/ocl/
and astropy to see what clusters are visible during our window at ARCSAT.

Date: Wednesday, April 17

I died a little on the inside trying to do the FITS files assignment. I
started by using QFitsView and after waisting a lot of time trying to 
complete the assigned tasks, I gave up on Q and downloaded ds9. After 
many sighs and raised hands, I shakily managed to do the first part of 
the assignment. Trying to start the second part of the assignment, I 
realized the file I needed wasn't in the ones given.

Notes for ds9:
When creating a region, to draw it you have to go to edit then region.
For histogram graphs, to change the range you have to unclick automatic.

I am turning this journal in early since I won't be able to go to class on 
Friday.

Joke of the week: What is an astronauts favorite key on they keyboard?
                  The space bar!

Week 4

Date: Monday, April 22

Today we worked on the lab for emission tubes and spectroscopes. In conclusion,
my eyes hurt. We also talked about CCDs in class and I was completely lost. What are counts??
What's going on with the Gaussian and Poisson distributions? What are the they telling us?
How are the incoming photons interacting with the electrons in the pixels? What is 
meant by continuous scales? What is the meaning of life??  AAAAAHHH!!!

Date: Wednesday, April 24

I have been working all day on my research project. I spent a few hours on 
trying to get a data file that is compatible with astroplan. Then I narrowed
hundreds of open stellar clusters down to about 60. I then narrowed it down 
even more to just Melotte 111 (Coma Stellar Cluster) and Stephenson 1 (del lyr
cluster).  I fisrt did all this with python, then to be more exact and
less reliant on my probably faulty code, Anika hit me up with 
arcsecond.io. A handy dandy site that does everything I was trying to do
in python but better. 

Date: Friday, April 26

I started the day by working on the CCD reading and assignment. I think I am starting to understand
them a little. Turns out counts are the voltage read out of each pixel's electrons, which makes
a lot more sense now. I continued working one my research project by starting up a Latex document
and creating a bib list with bibtext codes. I also looked more into how to make HR diagrams from CCD
images. I determined I will need to use a filters in blue and visual bands, and I will need to take a
dark flat for the same time amount of time I take my actually images. 
Note: be careful with leaving FITS files open.

WEEK 5

Date: Monday, April 29

We started the CCD lab today, but my group didn't have a chance to start
getting any data, but hopefully we'll start on Wednesday. Instead, I tried to 
get prepared for observing on the ARCSAT. I have learned that there is still 
much more I have to do. It's a bit overwhelming.

Date: Wednesday, May 1

We got the CCD data today, which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. 
Everything went smoothly. I just hope we didn't forget to take any
pictures. Now, I gotta go through a lot of fits files and figure out
what to do with them. Being able to use the tools hands on really helped
me understand a little more on how the stuff works.

Date: Firday, May 3

I managed to get through a lot of the data analysis of the CCD lab. I still 
need to get the dark current and perhaps figure out why my gain is so
low (currently 0.09...). I am rather greatful for the sample code given to 
us from canvas, thank you.

WEEK 6

Date: Monday, May 6

I continued work on the CCD lab. Anika and I went back to collect some more 
flats from the KIA because we didn't quite reach saturation. The new pictures
did reach saturation, but they cause a bit of wonkiness. Also, in class we
talked more about CCDs and what to do with the info we collect through bias
and darks and flats. I feel like I am starting to understand this stuff, but
I am not quite there. I think I just need to keep going over it and actually
do the corrections to get a better understanding.

As for my observing project, I logged on to ARCSAT without any problems, so
I should be good to go for Thursday. I am not certain what images I will need
to get. I know I will need melotte 111 in a few different filters, but I don't
know how long nor if I will need flats and darks and all that jazz. 

Date: Wednesday, May 8

Started on a new lab today even though I haven't finished the CCD one yet. 
The pressure is on. I did little things to get ready for observing tomorrow.
Made a checklist, found star chart (not sure if I really know how to use it),
checked again if I could log in, prayed for good weather, sacrificed a goat
or two, just small things. 

Date: Friday, May 10

I should sacrificed more goats, perhaps also a chicken or two? The weather
last night showed the fury of an old, eldritch god, and tonight, the weather
is supposed to be just as terrible. On the bright side, I can go dancing
instead!  

Worked more on the CCD lab. I'm still struggling...at lot. Things just dont
wanna work.

WEEK 7

Date: Monday, May 13

Finished up and turned in the CCD lab. I don't feel too confident on my 
results, but, hey, it's finished, and I can put it behind me. After
that, I started working on the reducing imaging data lab. I have done the bias
and flat part, but not the overscan nor all the photometry. I have circles
around stars. Not sure if it's correct, but there are circles and they are
around stars. Yay.

Date: Wednesday, May 15

Worked on the reducing images lab. I worked for a long time but didn't make
much progress. It's really frustrating. I realized I didn't have ccdproc, and
trying to get it on my computer was a  mess. 

Date: Friday, May 17

I came in early today to work on the reducing images lab. I didn't make much
progress despite working for two hours. I just can't seem to remove the 
overscan nor figure out PSF fitting. I'm so lost, but greatful for the 
extension on the due date. We talked about the first draft of our project in
class. I haven't really started on that due to having to rework my project
since APO was rained out when I needed to use it. I still want to work with
the Coma Stellar Cluster, and I will probably just grab existing data and 
work with that.

WEEK 8

Date: Monday, May 20

Today was a peer review day. I finished that pretty fast and moved on to work 
on my project. I made quite a few color magnitude diagrams for my star
clusters. Unfortunately, only one of them looked like a CMD, the rest looked
like garbage, but at least I know the code is correct. So, I am guessing
something is wrong with the data from WEBDA. It's probably not exactly
what I think it is.

Date: Wednesday, May 22

I did more work on the data reduction lab. I am almost done. All I have to do 
is find an image with a different filter and do the same photometry as the 
quadRU image.

Date: Friday, May 24

Came in early to finish up the data reduction lab. My code that worked 
Wednesday no longer works today, and I had to figure out why. It was quite
fustrating, and the results do not look as good as they did on Wednesday.
However, it's turned in and I am done with it. Hmph.

I started working on the new lab and discovered that Zelda exist in the M16
stellar clusters.

I also did more work on my research project. I still have ugly color
diagrams. 


Joke of the Week: 

Two spiral galaxies walk into a bar.

The first one goes up to the bar and asks for two drinks, one for him and one
for his friend.

The barman looks suspiciously at the second spiral galaxy and says "I' sorry
but I can't serve your friend, he'll have to go."

The first spiral galaxy complains, "Why can't you serve him?"

The barman replies, "Because he's barred."

I couldn't find a good ASCII galaxy so here is an ASCII and a joke.

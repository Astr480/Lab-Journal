This first week was spent setting up github and getting use to it.
I reviewed some Unix commands.
I found out I could use nano as a txt editor (learned how to save and exit).
I don't really know what I am supposed to put in lab journals.
I also have no idea what I want to research or even how to figure out what I
want to research.

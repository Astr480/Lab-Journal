Day 19:

first draft:
  introduction
  outline of project approach
  current status

how much energy did this object release?
  what is the shape? which pixels?
  other sources of photons?

point spread function
  even with no aberrations, airy disk

sky background
  zodiacal interplanetary dust near ecliptic creates reflects light
  local atmosphere

  subtract sky

different approaches:
  aperture
  PSF

list of things at positions
at these positions what is value?


Day 20:
  trying and failing to work with apertures on photutils

Day 21:

Writing Scientific Papers
  Approach:
    answer a question
    reproducibility: show exact process so someone else can do same experiment
    tie into larger context
      science is a conversation
      find relevant works
  Sections:
    Introduction
    Methods/Data
      probably bulk of paper
      nothing should only exist in caption
    Results/Discussion
      intellectual risks
      guess about what results mean
    Conclusion/Summary
  Reference everything
    go through each assertion and find literature references
    use ADS search to find body of knowledge for a topic

Bring 2 copies on Monday

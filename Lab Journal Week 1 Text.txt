ASTR 480
Lab Journal: Week 1

A basic overview of what I did this week for ASTR 480. Some GitHub/computing terminology below may not have been used correctly at times.
4/1/19
-	First day of ASTR 480.
-	Intro to Unix – exploring basic Unix commands, such as for moving through directories and viewing the “invisible” files
-	Intro to GitHub – basic overview, and basic tutorial which covered features such as branches and pull requests
-	Created a GitHub account for myself and viewed the ASTR 480 repository on GitHub

4/3/19
-	Second day of ASTR 480.
-	More in-depth tutorials on using GitHub and on its functionality (creating a text file and uploading it to my repository on GitHub, making changes to the file and merging them to the master branch, etc.)
-	Basic overview of how to upload the Lab Journal to the ASTR 480 repository, and creating a pull request so that Prof. Tuttle can accept and see the journal file
-	Collaborated with a partner to access each other’s “practice” repositories (titled “Planets”), make changes to each other’s files, and push the changes back to the other partner

4/5/19 (before class)
-	Created this Lab Journal entry for Week 1
-	Reviewed the tutorials on GitHub that we went through (rather quickly) in class, so that I could (attempt) to remember how to upload a text file containing my Week 1 Lab Journal file
-	Reviewed GitHub tutorials to review (and learn) the basic functionality, such as pull requests, branches, etc.

~This entry turned out more detailed than I anticipated~

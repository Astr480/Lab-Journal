Create lab journal and push to repo by class (Done!)


Start thinking about possible research topics:
	lyman alpha forest?
		Is this a possible observation using available telescopes? #### FIND OUT
	QSO observations?
		Whats the upper bound on detectable luminosity of available telescopes? ### FIND OUT
		Possibly observing Q1241+176         12 44 10.8248623367 +17 21 04.509382201

	




Observation using Lick Observatory:
	Observe QSO's
	Using SDSS northern data from washington site
	Right skeleton code for assignment

	TODO:
		### DONE #### make skyview plots
		### DONE #### determine if objects are visible during hours of observing (midnight to midnight)
		### DONE #### determine moon phase during observation hours
		#### DONE ####
 		finish assingment 


CLASS PROJECT NOTES:
	Gaia DR2 took photometric data on QSO Q1241-176
	VERON-CETTY M. -P. and VERON P. A catalogue of quasars and active nuclei: 13th edition
		contains info on QSO 
		COntains info on position, redshift, photometry as well
	SDSS Quasar catalog V. Seventh data release
		also took flux measurements of QSO 
		OBJ_ID: SDSS J123310.82+172104.5

	possible questions:
		spectra on Q1241+176? Possible with available telescopes?
			could we measure the lyman alpha forest with this?
				could be a bit of a stretch....
		Perhaps compare the structure function to other typical structure functions.
		

	can access SDSS DR7 by skyserver.sdss.org/dr7/en/


	### URL for QSO Q1241+176 spectra:

	Some papers and webistes on QSO time variability:
		
		Time Variability of Quasars: the Strucutre Function Variance
		basis characteristics of variability ------> https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept01/Peterson2/Peter2_1.html
		UW (macleod) time variability data -------> http://faculty.washington.edu/ivezic/macleod/qso_dr7/
		Letter on Quasar variability and Gravitational microlensing ------> https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/310689/fulltext/5165.text.html
	
	Interesting project that used data collected at APO to look for QSO variations:
		https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/380563/pdf

	CONCERNS:
		How well can we resolve the object? ----> Probably point source. Should fill a few pixels
		What range of wavelengths can we observe?

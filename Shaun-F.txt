Create lab journal and push to repo by class (Done!)


Start thinking about possible research topics:
	lyman alpha forest?
		Is this a possible observation using available telescopes? #### FIND OUT
	QSO observations?
		Whats the upper bound on detectable luminosity of available telescopes? ### FIND OUT
		Possibly observing Q1241+176         12 44 10.8248623367 +17 21 04.509382201

	




Observation using Lick Observatory:
	Observe QSO's
	Using SDSS northern data from washington site
	Right skeleton code for assignment

	TODO:
		### DONE #### make skyview plots
		### DONE #### determine if objects are visible during hours of observing (midnight to midnight)
		### DONE #### determine moon phase during observation hours
		#### DONE ####
 		finish assingment 


CLASS PROJECT NOTES:
	Gaia DR2 took photometric data on QSO Q1241-176
	VERON-CETTY M. -P. and VERON P. A catalogue of quasars and active nuclei: 13th edition
		contains info on QSO 
		COntains info on position, redshift, photometry as well
	SDSS Quasar catalog V. Seventh data release
		also took flux measurements of QSO 
		OBJ_ID: SDSS J123310.82+172104.5

	possible questions:
		spectra on Q1241+176? Possible with available telescopes?
			could we measure the lyman alpha forest with this?
				could be a bit of a stretch....
		Perhaps compare the structure function to other typical structure functions.
		

	can access SDSS DR7 by skyserver.sdss.org/dr7/en/


	### URL for QSO Q1241+176 spectra:

	Some papers and webistes on QSO time variability:
		
		Time Variability of Quasars: the Strucutre Function Variance
		basis characteristics of variability ------> https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept01/Peterson2/Peter2_1.html
		UW (macleod) time variability data -------> http://faculty.washington.edu/ivezic/macleod/qso_dr7/
		Letter on Quasar variability and Gravitational microlensing ------> https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/310689/fulltext/5165.text.html
	
	Interesting project that used data collected at APO to look for QSO variations:
		https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/380563/pdf

	CONCERNS:
		How well can we resolve the object? ----> Probably point source. Should fill a few pixels
		What range of wavelengths can we observe?
			what wavelengths should I look in?



April 22th, 2019:
	Start thinking about observations.
		I'll start writing code for the observations.
		I'll need observing window for APO that were allocated for our class.
		Start thinking about what I am trying to do with this QSO.
	Ill take a look at the homework and put it in my schedule.
		I'll start the homework this thursday so that I can spend the weekend doing my General Relativity homework.
	##### Class notes #####
		Today we talked about probability distributions.
			I remember all this from the laboratory methods physics class.
			gaussian and poisson distributions.
			photons following poisson statistics
				because were counting them...
		
		Variations in CCD readout cause gaussian variations about the bias level
			this will be important when filtering the data.
			should be uncorrelated in ideal world
				could be correlated if some solid states are broken\not working properly
		
		Talked about charge transfer
			readout to signal amplifier
		compared different quantum efficiencies
			how good the energy transfer is from photons to electrons
			is of course energy (wavelength) dependent
		discussed basic characteristics of CCDs
			responsive in optical
			gain is instrinsic
			CCDs are linear to a point
		discussed microchannel plates
			I remember learning about these in Scott Andersons class
		noise sources in CCDs:
			shot noise ---> Variation in photon arrival time (poisson)
			thermal noise ---> noise generated by 'hot' electronics. added electrons. Will need to take a 'dark' for the same amount of time of the observation
			read noise ---> variations in the CCD readout cause normal distributions around bias.
			bias
			--------> These add in quadrature
		############## end of lecture notes ####################
		

		We then did a class project with emission lines and filters.





April 24, 2019:
	
	Finished class project last time. Today are continued working on my research project.
	Wrote some code that tells me the observing time of the QSO (when its up, airmass, etc.). Looks like I should be able to do some pretty good observing during the allotted time. 
	I continued my research on the theory of quasar variabilitiy (mainly on the structure function, which I will most likely use and compare to other quasars).


	Research Project Notes:
		

		Ensemble Photometric Variability paper:
			Quasars exhibit continuum variability on order of 10% on timescale of months to years.
			Anticorrelation between quasar variability and luminosity found
			Strong evidence that variability increases with decreasing rest wavelength.
			correlation of variability with redshift reported
			variability sometimes found to be correlated with radio loudness
			they assumed the concordance cosmology with H0 = 65 kmps per Mpc.




April 25, 2019 (outside class):
	
	read a bit on the structure function. Definition is here ---> http://faculty.washington.edu/ivezic/REU08/quasarweb/structure/structure1.html
	Another definition of the structure function ---> https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0411348.pdf

	I need to start looking into collecting early data for the QSO. 
	
	I obtained fits files from DR12 for this QSO. 



April 26, 2019:
	TA went through some Python tutorials. I spent some time working on my GR homework.
	
	I continued studying the structure function

	I also obtained more fits files for this QSO from earlier SDSS releases

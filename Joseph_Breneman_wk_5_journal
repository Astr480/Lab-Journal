Journal entry week_3
Monday (4/29/19):
*We started a new assignment today and spent time in the lab getting biases and flat images on the CCD. There was a lot of trial and error getting the camera to work. We had to use an old desktop, the nostalgia was heavy.
*We ended up getting the data we needed and found a saturation value of around  52000.
*Decided on the objects to observe for my project. A long term variable in M3 (V154, with a period of ~15 days) which has observation records dating back over a century, and a short term variable star with a period of around 4 days.

Wednesday (5/1/19):
*Today in class I completely mismanaged my time and got next to nothing done. I read through the "Characterizing a CCD" assignment about 5 times and I'm pretty sure I have retained nothing other than I have to turn something in at sometime. FOCUS!
*I have been reading more of the papers related to my observing project, and it looks like B band will be the most useful filter for my targets. 
*Look into data reducing for making light curves of my targets.
*Gather as much data (from previous observations) available for my targets.

Friday (5/3/19):
*Observing tonight. 11:30-12:30
*I need to finish reading the user manual for ARCSAT.
*Go through the tunneling process that the professor described in the attachment to the email she sent out to the class.
*There may be a possibility to observe for a little while longer tonight. Collecting data over a longer period of time will be better when making a light curve.
*Observing V154 in might pose a problem since it is close to the bright center of M3.

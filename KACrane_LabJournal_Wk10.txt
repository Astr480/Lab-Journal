Day 27:

"No one's yet called me a bitch in my evaluations, so it's not clear whether I'm in fact a female professor."

Machine Learning:
  supervised:
    training data with "correct" results
  unsupervised:
    lets learner determine its own categories

  Naive Bayes
    only works if classes are fairly far apart
    fast
    has all limitations of Gaussian for overlapping regions

Day 28:

"we try not to physically assault each other in class; it's not helpful for learning"

Day 29:

I don't have any thoughts on anything at this point

Joseph Breneman week 9 journal

Monday (5/27/2019):
*It's a week before the last week of instruction, and I have a good start on my second draft for my project
*I have not started the SDSS lab yet, and I feel that as caught up as I am on my project paper I am that much behind on my other stuff.
*I spent a great deal of time going over and fine tuning everything for my reasearch paper this last weekend.
*I have some preliminary plots for my light curves and have a good idea where my project is goin.

Wednesday (5/29/2019):
*The second draft is due today for our project paper and I got a significant amount of the work done.
*There was some complications with sorting out a few observations that didn't turn out, and then taking out those observations from the observing period.
*I established that I observed my star for at least half of its predicted period of variability.
*There is a strong peak in my observation that correlates very well with a peak in the light curve of a previous survey taken of M3 that has data on my star (S2).

Friday (5/31/2019):
*I was very ill prepared for class today, and I have what feels like l=miles to go before my SDSS lab is complete.
*I have been working on my project to much, it's hard to switch gears when I'm in the flow, and I feel like I have a good flow going with my project at the moment, whichis a good sign I suppose.
*Professor Tuttle handed back our revised second draft for our project paper and it looks like good news, and most of what I have to do now is revise and embellish.
*I do need to try and fit the variability period to my data, because that is the whole point here.

Monday: Today I reviewed two papers and left comments. The papers were pretty
interesting, but I was generous with my comments because I believe that 
something is wrong if the first draft is not a mess.

I will level with you here. I had already finished my data lab assignment so
I spent the rest of that data learning about bees. Apparently it takes a total
of 2 million flowers to produce 1 lb of honey. Also in the lifetime of a bee
(120 - 150 ish days) they will produce 6 times their weight in honey.

Wednesday: I spent all of today buliding a composite image of my galaxy for 
the research project. I messed around with various different techniques and 
programs before ultimately deciding to just do it my own method and this 
ended up working out.

Friday: I spent all of today findiong a line of best fit through the center
of my galaxy and then turning those x and y values into a 2d array and 
creating a mask to find the flux of a image along that line. I then applied
that mask to each of my filter photos and plotted their relative flux vs 
the radius. I will do fitting for the brightness curve soon.

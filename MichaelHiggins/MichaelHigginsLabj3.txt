Monday:
I showed up to class late because I was giving a Monday meeting at 
CENPA.(It went really well, yay!) Once I got to class I started looking 
up papers for inspiration on what to observe and decied I wanted to do 
something ith surface brightness or photometry.

Wednesday:
I worked on the fits file stuff for the class period and got up to the 
first half of it done. One very important thing to remember with ds9 is 
that to select a region I need to change the cursor to region in order 
for that to work. ds9 is weird sometimes, but shutting it down and 
trying again seems to fix the bugs.

Friday:
I finished the second half of the fits assignment and decided to observe 
an AGN and try and gather data on its surface brightness and surface 
photometry. I am worried this may be too difficult since I have never 
done surface photometry before, but I hope it will all work out. I also 
checked and found a candidate for my AGN to observe.

Monday:
We spent all of today gathering data with the CCD. We placed a piece of
paper over the camera and turned the lights off to get all of our flats. For
our bias we took a .12s exposure with the lense cap on the camera.

Wednesday:
We were processing the data we got on Monday and had an issue where we were
finding our gain was negative. We tried to figure this out for the entire
class, but couldn't figure it out. I also set up my dates for observing
to be on Saturday and Sunday.

Friday:
We figured out the reason our gain was wrong was because our data was
formatted to int16 instead of int64. Making this switch gave us a reasonable
gain and read noise. We realized our flats did not expose up to saturation
so we will need to retake flats on Monday.

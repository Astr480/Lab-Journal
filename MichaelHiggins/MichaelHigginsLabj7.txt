Monday:
Began working on the Reducing Imaging Data assignment. I completed everything
except for the overscan part of the Data Reduction section. I used my images
of M82 to do this section. It went very smoothly.

Wednesday:
I began the photometry section of the lab and used the quadRU image for this.
I mostly copied the code from photoutils, but I needed to change quite a 
bit before running it because I noticed issues with the way it was reading
images. I completed everything except the PSF photometry.

Friday:
I finished the PSF photometry and went back and completed the overscan
portion with the wolf data. Then I uploaded everything to github photometry. 

SIDE NOTE: If no one else had offered I wouldn't mind spending some time over
the summer rewriting the labs. I was thinking I could do it in overleaf
and then people can fill out their answers in overleaf and submit that pdf
to a git folder along with their code.

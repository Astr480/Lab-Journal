This week we discussed how to use github.
Useful commands are listed below so I can use them later.

Cloning a forked repository 
"git clone [html]"                                                             *without the brackets

After cloning the forked repository I want to define the upstream as the 
class repository 
"git remote add upstream [html for class repository]"                          *without the brackets

Then I want to sync my repository with the class one
"git pull upstream master"
check this with "git remote -v"

Then I want to make my github repository up to date
"git push origin master"

Then I want to add my lab journal entry to my repository and go to 
GitHub to make a pull request and submit it.

commits are done with...
"git commit -m "This is my comment""

Monday:
Today I spent most of the day working through the ML homework. I got to the
last problem and wrote about galaxy morphology classification through machine
learning.

Wednesday:
I spent all of today struggling through the lab until finally realizing the 
reason it was not working was because I never downloaded the data. Whoops.

Friday: 
All done with everything. Keeping this short and sweet so you don't have to
waste any more time reading this. Thank you for a wonderful quarter!!

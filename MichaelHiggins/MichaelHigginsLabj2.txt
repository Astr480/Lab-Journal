This week I wrote some python code using Astroplan that could take a 
list of galaxies from the UGC catalogue and determine which objects 
would be visible on my observation day. Then I wrote code to create two 
lists for the RA and DEC of the objects which would return tuples in 
hours minutes seconds and degrees minutes seconds respectively.

On Wednesday I wrote code that would use Astroplan to create airmass vs observing time graph
 for all of my galaxies on the first observation dates and the second set of dates a month later.

I compared these values and then looked at the position of the moon of both observation months and
found that only one of my object a month later was >30 degrees away from the moon in the night sky.
This led me to conclude that I REALLY DO NOT want it to be cloudy on my first observation dates.

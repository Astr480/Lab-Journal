Monday:
Today I worked on my CCD code and began writing my paper in Overleaf. We
decided not to retake our flats for our linearity data since it would
take too much time so we are using data from another group.

Wednesday:
Today I started my reducing Imagining data assignment and began it using my
own data that I recorded from ARCSAT. I got as far as subtracting a master 
bias and dividing by the master flat.

Friday:
I spent all day working on making my Latex document for the CCD Lab Assignment
and formatting it. I have gotten up to the Linearity section completed and I
plan to finish it over the weekend. Fingers crossed my code still works and 
it won't take too long.

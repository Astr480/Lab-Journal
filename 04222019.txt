Notes for 04/22/2019:

Today was a simple day. We were handed a packet on 
spectroscopy, some filters, and a few gas lamps, then
were set loose to work. The work involved identifying 
the contents of the tubes using simple spectroscopes, 
discussed trends in the spectra, and explored the use 
of filters.

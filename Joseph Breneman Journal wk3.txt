Monday (4.15.19):
* Professor Tuttle spent time talking about the Proposal for the observation project.
* I am considering analyzing hubble frontier fields and possibly doing something with gravitational lensing, and hubble constant.
* Keep working on doing commeands from the terminal. Especially creating these journals and accessing directories.
* Got JSkyCalc to work, practice using it in kahoots with astropy.

Wednesday (4.17.19):
* Started the Fits assignment today, and downloaded SAOImageDS9.
* Use the fits data imaging notebook from Astro 300 to complete some of the assignemnt, especially the section inquiring about the Header deets. 
* Look more into the HST Frontier Fields and gravitational lensing.
* Can we use QFitsView to complete some of the Fits imaging assignment?
* Figure out if there are any observations that can be made with ARCSAT that could contribute to the HST frontier Fields.

Friday (4.19.19):
* Okay, so I read a little into the HST Frontier Fields and that's a hard no. 
* Decided to analyze variable stars in the M3 Globular cluster, and determine if the variable periods have changed for any stars.
* Found a variable star (V154) in M3 that has been previously observed to have an increasing variable period. This star has been observed for over a century.
* Getting a little worried that my observation window might not be long enough to determine the stars variable period.
* Used my notebook from the nightsky observing assignment to determine the quality of observations I will get for M3, and it looks like my airmass will be awesome for the entire observing window.
* Definitely focus on making sure my observations are as good as they can be, dates, times, weather.
* Start working on paper format and collecting data from previous papers that can be used to compare with my observational data.
* Revisit the LATEX Notebook from Astro 300.

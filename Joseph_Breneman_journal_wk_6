Joseph Breneman Journal Week 6
Monday (5/6/19):
*Got to use the telescope over the weekend. It was a lot easier than I thought. Accessing the the telescope did not require any tunneling. Regardless of location, the information on the PDF that Prof. Tuttle sent in the email works.
*I had two nights of good observations, got around 40 images total. The second night I realized that the object I am viewing is a double object, I will need to figure out how to separate the two so that I can build a light curve from my data for the object that I am trying to confirm its variability. 
*I have one more observing window on 5/11/19, Though I feel that I have enough data to use for my project, it would be nice to have too much data.

Wednesday (5/8/19):
*I have gathered a fair amount of material to reference for my reasearch paper, I now need to read through all of it more thuroughly and extract some data specific to the star I am trying to confirm its variability period.
*There are jupyter notebooks on canvas in relation to the "CCD" project due on monday. Que weak motivational statement to work on "CCD" project now so that I may finish it in a timely fashion. I won't listen, and this weekend will be hell. But, hell is warm, so I'll have that goin for me.
*We started a new project that appears to be due on 5/17, Data reduction, we are downloading data from ARCSAT to compile biases, darks and flats. 
*I plan on using my own data for the data reduction process, cause why not.

Friday (5/10/19):
*Today Prof. Tuttle gave a lecture about recognizing instrumental effects and identifying cosmic rays.
*On monday we are going to be discussing photometry, which is the second part of the Data Reduction project.
*As I noted on Wednesday, My procrastination to get started on things that are not due tomorrow is strong, jedi strong.
*On a good note, I have vetted some resources for my research paper,and picked up some other ones, so I am on a good road with that process
*I found a paper that has a vaguely defined period for the star that I am observing.

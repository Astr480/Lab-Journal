Day 10:

baffle responsible
restricts view

bias/overscan is a measurement of telescope electronics (amplifiers)


different regions in image governed by different statistics
  Poisson
    how many of something
    looks like Gaussian at large sample
    photon
      independent
      probability of arrival
      lots of photons approximates Gaussian
  Gaussian
    CCD electronics noise
    can calculate noise and gain from histogram

bias image: 0 sec image
  noise from individual pixels

detectors: device used to detect/measure/count electromagnetic radiation

Charge transfer
  each amplifier can only read one pixel at a time
  transfer charge from pixel to amplifier
  quantum efficiency: efficiency of converting photons to electrons
  moves charge from pixel to pixel
  read across row, then all rows shift down, repeat


back-thinned vs front illuminated
back-thinned have higher QE and wavelength responsivity

CCD notes
  CCDs are linear (counts propto photons)
  pixels can saturate
  gain is intrinsic
  responsive in optical
  commercially viable
  time resolution = exposure time


CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor)
  charge to voltage happens in each pixel
  each pixel has its own electronics (electronic behavior)

microchannel plate
  continuous time resolution

noise
  shot noise
    underlying (Poisson) photon noise
  thermal/dark current
    temperature of device means moving electrons
    why we cool CCDs
    adds electrons, more over more time
    "dark" needs to be same length as exposure time
  read noise
    due to bias level of CCD

Day 11:
  continuing hardware assignment

  how do you get practice reading spectral lines?

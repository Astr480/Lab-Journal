On monday I used more of AstroPy. We also reviewed some tools on how to observe. I started the next
assignment as well, and so far I'm having trouble cleaning up the database a little bit.
Will work on it and do some analysis to finish the worksheet.

On wednesday, I started sorting out and cleaning the data. First I converted the columns to the same
units so I could combine some of them. Had some frustrating experiences with pandas, so I converted 
the data to a AstroPy table. It worked out pretty well, now I will set up the observer to answer
all the questions on the homework.

Friday 4/5:

Use simbad to gain knowledge on specific stars or a group of stars
Ned is better for extragalactic research, learning about galaxies

Jskycalc: download it and try it out
iobserve is an alternative to Jskycalc

What to consider while observing:
Airmass is how much atmosphere is in between you and your object
The more vertical the better (at the zenith airmass=1)
You want an airmass at 1.5 or less
While observing consider what phase the moon is in because its brightness can effect observing greatly
When does your night actually start?
  Night does not start until a certain darkness


Monday 4/8:

To help find the best time to observe m31 you can see when the worst time to observe is and add 6 months
Do this by checking when it coincides with the sun the most


Next project: pick a partner, and work on observation project
work on through Friday and turn in on Monday
I am working with Travis Mandeville and we are researching galaxies
We are using the NGC catalog



Wednesday 4/10:

*Forgot to save my journal for this day so I am trying to fill it from memory

First optical picture taken of a black hole
It was a supermassive black hole in m87
It matches what a model would expect the galaxy to appear just very blurry

We have started finding galaxies to observe using simbad
Picked 20 galaxies and got their RA, DEC and epochs
We plugged them in Jskycalc and narrowed in down 10 galaxies that fit our window
NCG_34 and NGC_35 are going to be back up objects because their airmass never really gets under 1.5
Had to fight with Jskycalc because it had a lot of trouble accepting our object list
Travis figured out how to get it to create an airmass graph for all of our objects
We were also able to use jskycalc to view if the moon would affect our observations using the seasonal
observability tool


Friday 4/12:

Created my folder for NightSky with my screenshots from jskycalc and my writeup
screenshots are of the airmass graph and seasonal observability table

Finishing up my writing for the Planning observations assignment
Getting everything together on my computer to send into github
Checked that my write up included everything it needed
It's easier than I thought to push a folder into github, had a slight problem with a space in my folder name
Not much to do today

Friday 5/24:

PSF is impossible but everyone seems to be having the same trouble
except Joe

New lab on archival data

Finally got psf to run but it looks horrible
Tried to fix it but my stomach feels horrible so Im going home 



Wednesday 5/22:

Joe pointed out that I was not using quadru the whole time
plot is a lot simpler once i got the correct fits file in

Found 191 stars but need to get rid of the bad stars
I believe i used the center method but it might be the subpixel, we'll see

apeture radius of 5
annulus min of 3 and max of 8

Subtracted flux and the plot is pretty erratic but it should do
On friday I'll finish up with PSF



Monday 5/20:

Peer reviewed two different papers
both look much more professional than mine
I struggled to give notes because both papers were so short

Preston gave me good tips on how to defend lomb scargle
Also how to describe what it does

Back to working on data reduction assignment



Friday 5/17:

Reducing image data lab is not due until next friday
Thank christ

Finish up reducing data today
Start on first draft research paper this weekend

Writing paper:
Write out all of the steps through your paper
Reproducibility
Bring it into context with what is happening in the field

Needs a method and data section
Results and discussion is used for talking about what your results mean

discussed game of thrones



Wednesday 5/15:

glob in list of biases
ccdproc.combine

Overscan is like a bias layered on top of an image
No idea how to trim the Overscan
Probably have to find the dimensions of the Overscan

Using wolf for the biases, but arcsat data for the flats

reduced fits file in the assignment page
How do i scale the fits file like I would in ds9



Monday 5/13:

Data reduction lab is due friday, first draft is due Monday
It does not need to be perfect, but have a good outline of where your paper is going

photometry:
The sky glows so every pixel has sky count in it

Start the reducing image data assignment
CCDproc to make master bias



Friday 5/10:

Was not in class, nothing to report



Wednesday 5/8:

Learning about data reduction today

download ccdproc
in the command line, get to apo archive
Download biases, flats, objects and darks

Cannot find sky flats or darks to save my life
Got em

Checking out the biases
  one dud, but the rest are fine

Darks
  all good

Dome flats



Monday 5/6:

Outline of our day:
Learn about ccd
Work on the ccd paper

Full well - maximum number of electrons for a pixel
Read noise - voltage uncertainty

How do we measure?
Full well - using a photon transfer curve
Read noise - calculation SD of bias
Dark current- taking dark frames
QE - flats with well calibrated and controlled illumination

Two kinds of saturation
Full well saturation
ADU saturation

Working on a CCD problem
All in electrons

Data reduction:

Dont set bias to 0, adds negative numbers to your reduction
Bias is a function of readout, not of time

Take flats in the filter you will be observing in

Back to the CCD assignment
My linearity plot is completely out of whack
Spent the next 20 min watching Preston troubleshoot the plot and finally get it working




Friday 5/3:

Reread the assignment
Check out the jupyter notebooks

Notebook will not open my fits files beacause exptime is not in the header
Turns out it needs to be exposure
Our data is linear enough

On to the gain
gain of about 0.4
read noise of about 16 (is this right?)



Wednesday 5/1:

Today we're reading through the assignment
Start on the analysis

First draft of final paper is due May 20th, I should probably get on that

Sarah talked about the education system
Research is much more important than teaching ability
Reminds me of Bulgac

Trying to read this assignment but keep zoning out



Monday 4/29:

Picking groups to work with for the next couple weeks

We are the first group to use the ccd thing
Taking biases and flats
biases were easy enough, but it is extremely difficult to find the saturation point of the flat

To get the right amount of light into the box we tried to hold it open with a pencil and different sizes of tapes
We also tried a flashlight but that brought in too much light
Eventually the pencil ended up letting in the right amount of light
Saturation at about 90 seconds



Friday 4/26:

Learning about coding and downloading from databases
Vizier
You can control the dimensions of the catalog you download
Reading in a csv, you can use delimwhitespace so it recognizes spaces

All done with pandas
There can be a lot of trouble just trying to get a catalog in order

After the lecture start working on ccd homework

Wednesday 4/24:

Today working on the light filters
Most simple part of the lab

No other work to do
Finsih up all of the writing on the lab, then head out



Monday 4/22:

Distributions:
Photons usually follow Poisson distribution unless it is a flat which is more gaussian

Bias is a 0 second image
A detector will mean a device that used to measure electromagnetic radiation

Charge transfer:
Charge is transferred from pixel to pixel until it gets to the amplifier
As charge is transferred thousands of times there can be complications

CCD:
They are linear
Pixels can saturate, gain is intrinsic
need cooling, but should not be cooled too much because it slows electrons

Playing with light today, through spectroscopes
Plastic blue spectroscopes are extremely tough



Friday 4/19:

Some lessons on observing
Focus on what you are observing, and what you are trying to observe

We are going to do a quick assignment on the life of a photon
It hits the instrument before it hits the ccd (the detector)

Techniques on how to view flux of objects
  imaging
  photometry
  spectroscopy

Filters differ in transmission percentages and what wavelength they let in
Less transmission means less light getting through so you must observe longer

Finally decided on my project proposal with 20 minutes to go
Finish the lab for this week over the weekend



Wednesday 4/17:

Still no idea what to do for the project, outside of it being on exoplanets

Starting lab for the week, looking at fits files to better understand ccd
Started with fitsviewer but switched to ds9, seems to work better

Checked out certain regions of a flat, and the overscan
The histogram overscan has a fairly normal distribution
The histogram of the regions have a extremely skewed distribution

On to the bias frame (has not been exposed to light)
Mean is much smaller but that is expected



Monday 4/15:

Start working on project proposals this week
No idea what my topic will be

There will be observing time at arcsat
Even if you have a partner you must submit your own write up and code

Reading scientific papers:
Read the abstract then the conclusion before reading the whole paper
It can help to write a summary of a paper so you can actually see if you have an understanding of the paper


Use Annual reviews of astronomy to check out some papers and think about a possible topic
Make sure to find a topic that I can find an archive for
Looking at exoplanets (maybe inhabitable ones, maybe hot jupiters)



Friday 4/12:

Created my folder for NightSky with my screenshots from jskycalc and my writeup
screenshots are of the airmass graph and seasonal observability table

Finishing up my writing for the Planning observations assignment
Getting everything together on my computer to send into github
Checked that my write up included everything it needed
It's easier than I thought to push a folder into github, had a slight problem with a space in my folder name
Not much to do today



Monday 4/8:

To help find the best time to observe m31 you can see when the worst time to observe is and add 6 months
Do this by checking when it coincides with the sun the most


Next project: pick a partner, and work on observation project
work on through Friday and turn in on Monday
I am working with Travis Mandeville and we are researching galaxies
We are using the NGC catalog



Wednesday 4/10:

*Forgot to save my journal for this day so I am trying to fill it from memory

First optical picture taken of a black hole
It was a supermassive black hole in m87
It matches what a model would expect the galaxy to appear just very blurry

We have started finding galaxies to observe using simbad
Picked 20 galaxies and got their RA, DEC and epochs
We plugged them in Jskycalc and narrowed in down 10 galaxies that fit our window
NCG_34 and NGC_35 are going to be back up objects because their airmass never really gets under 1.5
Had to fight with Jskycalc because it had a lot of trouble accepting our object list
Travis figured out how to get it to create an airmass graph for all of our objects
We were also able to use jskycalc to view if the moon would affect our observations using the seasonal
observability tool



Friday 4/5:

Use simbad to gain knowledge on specific stars or a group of stars
Ned is better for extragalactic research, learning about galaxies

Jskycalc: download it and try it out
iobserve is an alternative to Jskycalc

What to consider while observing:
Airmass is how much atmosphere is in between you and your object
The more vertical the better (at the zenith airmass=1)
You want an airmass at 1.5 or less
While observing consider what phase the moon is in because its brightness can effect observing greatly
When does your night actually start?
  Night does not start until a certain darkness

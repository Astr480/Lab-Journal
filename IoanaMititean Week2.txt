Lab Journal: Week 2

- Continued working on the Python code to answer the 4 questions about observing M31 (listed on the class lecture slides from the previous day in class).
- Looked back over my ASTR 300 code for planning observations with Astroplan, and applied some of the code to observations of M31.
- 'Navigating the Night Sky' short project was introduced, I teamed up with a partner, chose an object type and chose to code in Jupyter Notebook (Python).

- Learned how to navigate the Milliquas quasar catalog on Heasarc, selected 50 potential targets and saved them as a CSV file. Unfortunately for me, the 
quasars were ordered by RA, so I chose to sort the entire catalog alphabetically by quasar name (which helped increase the variety of RAs for the targets). 
- Determined which objects were visible at night (above the horizon) manually by examining their RAs and DECs and deciding whether each would be visible from my
observing location (I removed objects which were obviously not visible).
- Began coding up observations in Jupyter Notebook and planning out how I will organize my code to determine the observability of 10 chosen targets.
- Looked online for the formatting of celestial object coordinates that are accepted by SkyCoord; observed that it is possible to pass in the coordinates as formatted
on the original Milliquas Catalog, but requires some manipulation. Contented to handpick 10 observable objects based on RA and DEC (and observatory
location), and then manually modify the coordinate format to be accepted by SkyCoord in my code. I plan to find how to pass in the coordinates without manual manipulation, but requires more time than I had to complete this project.

- Continued coding in Jupyter Notebook to complete the 'Navigating the Night Sky' project with partner. I examined Astr 300 code for planning observations with Astroplan, 
and created an observability table for my quasar targets that lists whether each target is at all observable during the observing window and for what fraction of the 
entire observing window each is visible.  
- I successfully coded up a plot of the airmass of the targets versus time (throughout the observing window).
- Completed my code and paper for the assignment as class ended. 
- Created and filled in this journal entry (Week 2), and updated it as the class day progressed.

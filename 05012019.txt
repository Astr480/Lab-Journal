Notes for 05/01/2019:

Today was spent mainly on three tasks.

First, I read through the theory and practical 
descriptions of the measurements we did in the last 
section.

Second, I studied up on how to use AstroPy for FITS 
file manipulation. Unfortunately, none of this is 
particularly simple. I'm excited to hear I have at least 
one weekend to do this, and plan to use that time well. 
(Quit laughing - it could happen.)

Finally, I listened to Prof. Tuttle deliver a fantastic 
impromptu discussion on the current state of higher 
education in the United States. I'm no longer upset 
at having been rejected by all of the programs I applied 
to.

Joseph Breneman Week 4 Journal make-up
Soo, yeah, don't really know what to write, I completely neglected to keep a journal for that week, and I can barely remember what happened last week, much less 6 weeks ago. So I suppose I'll make a journal entries worth of comments from the quarter regarding the class. I understand if this isn't counted for a make-up grade, but an attempt had to be made.

Astro 480:
*I liked this class more than I thought I would. I went in thinking that it would be a somewhat redundant class of data vomit, more like a stats class than an actual astro class. I was pleasantly suprized when I found that I was wrong in this assumption.
*I found  analyzing astronomical data, and making sense of the images and pictures we are taking of the cosmos delightful.
*I liked using ARCSAT and found the process of going from raw image to conclusive results was a lengthy and not always a clear path, much error, such trials.
*The in-class time where we were allowed to work on various assignments was an irreplaceable aspect of the course. That was when most of my issues with coding, or general direction in an assignment were answered.
*If I could do it all again I would have got a jump on my final project earlier than I did. I assumed the class would slow down at toward the end of the quarter, but I again assumed incorrectly.
*The error allowed in personal interpretation of answers to assignment/lab/project questions ultimately assisted in retaining more knowledge than a course where I am supposed to just regurgitate some words from a book, or just fill in the blanks of some code template. Requiring me to make my own interpretaions of things, whether those interpretations  were right or wrong, ultimately allowed me to think harder and longer about the topics presented, and although my answers may have been wrong more so than other courses, I learned a great deal more about how to think about things (e.g: plan of attack when figuring out a problem). The leniency in allowing for these errors encouraged me to feel more confident in my own thinking, which is a priceless aspect of any course.

Have a great Summer!

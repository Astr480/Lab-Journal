Continue working on the navigating project, it got really messed up. EVENTUALLY
I got something to work. Still unsure if I am actually doing the right thing,
but at least the table is working now! Next time I will be looking at the moon
illumination and changing the date. Hoepfully I'll get it done. I am learning
more about formating tables.

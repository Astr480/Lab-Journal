Continue working on the navigating project, it got really messed up. EVENTUALLY
I got something to work. Still unsure if I am actually doing the right thing,
but at least the table is working now! Next time I will be looking at the moon
illumination and changing the date. Hoepfully I'll get it done. I am learning
more about formating tables.

I am continuing to work on the project. I am not looking at the moon
illumintion part. So it is basically done. still having a few issues doing
some of the extra stuff, like plotting the moons path across the sky.

I looked over a few different articles and decided to do something with
globular clusters. I think I will be comparing globular clusters. One 
of which possibly created an open cluster. The paper discusses the proper 
motion, but I would also like to look at some of th eother factors, like
luminosity or the cmd or age. basically see that if there are any other
factors. I'd also like to see if there are any open clusters near by 
globular cluster of choice.

looking over things to observe. i have finished my proposal and am excited
to start! Although I am still concerned I ont be able to get the code to
work.. Leanred more about the CMD. Look up more about Photometry. round stars
and pixels, only use full pixels.

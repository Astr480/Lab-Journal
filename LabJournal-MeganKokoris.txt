Test. I am testing to make sure this works

open NightSky then jupyter notebook then astroconda and attempt to run. git add NAME git commit -m "" git push

will be given an observatory and a night, look for a month later. find a list 
that has about 20 items. is it better to get rained out?

Continue working on the navigating project, it got really messed up. EVENTUALLY
I got something to work. Still unsure if I am actually doing the right thing,
but at least the table is working now! Next time I will be looking at the moon
illumination and changing the date. Hoepfully I'll get it done. I am learning
more about formating tables.

I am continuing to work on the project. I am not looking at the moon
illumintion part. So it is basically done. still having a few issues doing
some of the extra stuff, like plotting the moons path across the sky.

I looked over a few different articles and decided to do something with
globular clusters. I think I will be comparing globular clusters. One 
of which possibly created an open cluster. The paper discusses the proper 
motion, but I would also like to look at some of th eother factors, like
luminosity or the cmd or age. basically see that if there are any other
factors. I'd also like to see if there are any open clusters near by 
globular cluster of choice.

we looked at stuff with ds9, turn region on in edit before drawing the box. the ceter and size
have to do with x1 x2 y1 y2 i think.

looking over things to observe. i have finished my proposal and am excited
to start! Although I am still concerned I ont be able to get the code to
work.. Leanred more about the CMD. Look up more about Photometry. round stars
and pixels, only use full pixels.

overscan, light has been blocked, only a little scattered light getting through
"souls have been trapped in telescope"
undering lying guides for distributions to understand what is happening in the system
CCD linear, to a point
pixels saturate
CCD changing in temperature, cool them or dark current will be high, also can't be
too cold or the electrns will be sluggish. 100secod image, need a dark thats a 100
second. dark same length as data working with. I looked at many lamps today. so 
many lamps.


4/24 I worked on the CCD homework, finished the lab and looked at when my
globular clusters will ride and set.

simbad, visar(?), everything that isnt important has a comment sign in front
(.... ,comment'#', delim_whitespace=True) instead of delim_ use(.., sep='\t')
de.drop([0,1]) #to drop rows, to do this to the original add# ,inplace=True]
mix type: string, float, int.. but sometimes it misses them. make all columns
numbers, .dtype

na_filer=
basically just keep trying stuff.

Day 13:

CCD characterization lab
  must keep track of all details personally, even though in group
  write lab report by self

  1x1 binning throughout
  don't want flat to saturate (need to expose for less time)
    same counts
    weird shapes
  intentionally saturate to measure linearity

  can't expose for much less than 0.1 sec

  f5 VPN to access ARCSAT

Day 14:
  collecting data with CCD

  do I need to convert/rename .fit to .fits?

  weird circle in images
  lines on bias field: why aren't they the same value all
  along line?

Day 15:
  tiny, negative gain: wrong but fine

  need to saturate CCD: Meredith's fault

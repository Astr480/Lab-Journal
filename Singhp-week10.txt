Monday

Today in class we went 
over machine learning.
I also worked on Draft 3 a little bit.
I have a good idea on what to add to my project.
Discussion on machine learning was very interesting!
I also learned about unsupervised learning, supervised
learning and reinforcment learning.

Wednesday
We worked off the slides on the projector.
Worked on machine learning tutorial and 
tried excercise 2.
I got draft 3 back and have to work on adding
some more pages to my project.

Friday
Made a Yay and Nay list on what was good
in the class and what wasn't good.
Spent the rest of class in pain writing
my paper :(.

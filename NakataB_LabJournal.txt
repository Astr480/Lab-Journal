April 1st:
Worked through syllabus and learned the basics of github. Most of the github
material, I have already learned but was good as a refresher

April 3rd:
Worked on collaborating through github. Followed a novice guide and worked through conflicts

April 5th:
Turning in Lab Journal

April 15th:
-Started to consider ideas about possible data/observing projects.
-Took a look at the Annual review in order to find some possible projects
-Looked at some papers considering black holes but tended to focus on gravitational lensing

April 17th:
-Started work on the Fits files and Calibration frames
-Had some trouble trying to use QfitsView and decided to use DS9 instead
-Did not know what some of the terms were so had some trouble with overscan until finding out


April 19th:
-listened to lecture on a variety of materials
-proceed with the fits files adn calibration frames
-still having to calculate x and y coordinates by hand and unsure if there is something in ds9 to help

April 22nd: 
-Worked with spectrocopy and filters for the "Day of Hardware"
-Filters was the easiest to get through, had some trouble working the the
spectroscopes.
-Took a lot of time to calibrate the spectroscopes in order to observer the emission tubes

April 24th:
-Unforuntely, I was sick and was not able to attend class today however, we were supposed to
work on finishing the "Day of Hardware"

April 26th:
-Worked/learned about Pandas and fits from lecture
-Brainstormed possible ideas for observing projects.
-Possible ideas would be dark matter (this seem to hard though) and then focused on some idea
about dwarf galaxies

May 27th:
-No class today
-I personally worked on my project
-grabbed data from SDSS and started to work with some CMD in python

May 29th:
-Worked through SDSS Survey lab
-Had some trouble with the finding chart and am unsure on what an optimal size for it
would be. I decided to go with a .35 '' to pixel scale and 600 pixels due to size of the picture
and that it includes all of M67
-Worked a bit on my project outside of class, wrote some more code to get the plots looking better
-Filled out a couple of the sections but unsure how to analyze my plots

May 31st:
-Finished up working on the SDSS Lab
-Had some code issues when trying to mask the data into a inner and outer radius
-I had many problems with cross matching and am still a bit confused. I will need to go over what
to do a bit more before fully understanding.
-I tried to match SDSS, 2MASS and WISE but unsure how effective it was

Day 4:

talked about ways of checking observability conditions

began navigating assignment
working with Pratt
objects: merging Galaxies
database: Catalog of Merging Galaxies

working on getting table from separate HMS/DMS columns to 1 RA and Dec column
I think converting from a pandas table to an astropy table might make life with units easier


Day 5:

why are tables so frustrating

converted each RA column to hourangle then deg and each Dec col to Degree
adding RA cols to get RA, Dec cols to get Dec

I need to create an object based on each RA/Dec to check if it is in sky

only want objects that:
  airmass < 1.75 for 5hr
  up for 5hr in dark
check above for each night in observing window

switching to object-oriented to facilitate easier analysis

Day 6:

ugh time zones

everything was working but now nothing is

shouldn't i be able to subtract a Time object from another to get a TimeDelta objects
(I think i figured it out?)

my code is super slow

haven't dealt with the moon yet

Week 1
Created Lab Journal
Learned about how to use git
Introduced to the research paper and starting to think about what topic I'll do for the project

Week 2
Monday
Started using python to help plan observations.

Wednesday
We continued using python for planning.
Learned a command that creates a table for the observation period and spent a lot of time getting it to work

Friday
We learned how to use Moon Seperation Constraint
We checked our observations for the window a month past.

Followed path of a photon
Continued fits problem data

Week 4
Monday
Started the project. Took a lot of time to understand how to use the sprectrameter for the second part

Wednesday
Finished that project

Friday
Spent time on python.
Learned about vizier (https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR)

Week 5
Monday
We learned about the assignment

Wednesday
We did nothing

Friday
We took the data. We are also clearly the best group because we did it properly.


Week 6
Monday
We were given another assignment and started working on the one due next week

Wednesday
Continued working on the assignment

Friday
I missed this class due to being sick. Presumably the same as Wednesday


Week 7
Monday
Started Work on the Reducing Data Lab

Wednesday
Big day we worked on the Reducing data Lab and got a lot done

Friday
Continued to work on Reducing Data Lab

Week 8
Monday
We reviewed other people's lab. Since they were relatively short it wasn't too much extra work to grade two, so most of us did exactly that.

Wednesday
Worked on photometry part of the lab. Read a lot of the documents for the photoutls lab. Using example code written in it and reading how the functions worked I was able to complete parts of it.

Friday
New lab starting today. SDSS survey lab. I missed around a bit with SDSS but as I'm new to this I'm just messing around with the values to see what happens.This lab was good for me as it helped me understand how to use SDSS and this will be helpful for my project. 

Week 9
Monday
NO CLASS!

Wednesday
Worked on the SDSS part. Worked on it outside of class so got most of the plots done, and got stuck on problem 7 and waited to work from there in class on friday

Friday
We got stuck several times trying to read the data. The first time was totaly my fault. I didn't put it in the right place. The second issue was not. The data just has random strings throughout the data and couldn't plot them correctly due to this.

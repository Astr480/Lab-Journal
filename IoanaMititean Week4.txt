4/22/19
- 'Day of Hardware' activity introduced in class.
- Got into a group of about 10 people to work together on a section of the assignment. 
- My group began with the gas tubes section - observing the lit gases with the funky blue plastic-covered spectroscopes.
- Together, we spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out how these spectroscopes worked.
- For a while, I couldn't understand why I couldn't view any spectra through the scope. Soon I discovered it was because I wasn't pointing it in the correct direction.
- Eventually my group split up and went separate ways.
- After observing three different gas tubes with my spectroscope and drawing a rough sketch (with wavelengths labeled) of both, I moved on to a different section of
the activity - using the metal spectroscopes.
- After viewing two more gas tubes with the metal spectroscope, I drew rough sketches (with colors labeled) of the spectra I observed.
- After moving the slider and the rotating end of the scope, I described what happened mechanically and optically to the spectra. 
- As the class day came to a close, I put away my materials.

4/24/19
- Continuation of the 'Day of Hardware' activity from the previous class day. 
- First I retrieved a metal spectroscope from a small wooden box, and viewed one more gas tube with the scope.
- I drew a rough sketch (with colors labeled) of the spectral lines I viewed through the metal scope. 
- After messing around again with the scope's moving parts (the slider and the rotating end), I revised my description of what happened optically and mechanically 
when adjusting these parts. 
- After putting away the scope, I moved on to the third and last part of the activity - filters.
- After trying different combinations of filters and lights, I wrote down what I observed.
- After putting away the filters, I searched on the web for spectra of various elements, and tried to identify the spectra that I had observed in the gas tubes 
(with the blue plastic-covered spectroscopes). 
- I found online spectra that matched (closely enough) to what I had observed, and wrote these down (and my online reference).
- I turned in my 'Day of Hardware' worksheet before exiting class.

Notes for 05/15/2019:

Today was a work day. I work better at home, so 
I left for home soon after arriving.

I worked on the data reduction lab for a few hours 
after getting home. It is going smoothly, for the 
most part, but CCDProc makes it a pain to trim 
overscan from the middle of  images. I wound up 
spending much of my time just sorting out how to 
do so.

Notes for 05/13/2019:

Today in class we discussed photometry and some of 
the decisions that one has to make while analyzing 
photometric data. The conversation mainly focused 
on aperture photometry, but also touched on the more 
general point-spread function (PSF)  photometry. I 
think that I will find PSF photometry to be more 
powerful, but substantially more involved. Time will 
tell.

We also installed photutils. This, thankfully, went 
very smoothly.

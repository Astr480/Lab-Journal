Notes for 03/08/2019:

A new week, a new assignment. This time, we are
tasked with planning a basic observation from
a given observatory using either JSkyCalc or
AstroPy. I'm using AstroPy, as my current job
prospects all ask for Python experience.

Things went well initially. Tom (my partner for
the assignment) and I drew a list of 50 bright 
galaxies. We created a script using AstroPy and 
AstroPlan that applied observation constraints 
to the list of galaxies and produced a table 
detailing each object and its observability.

Sadly, none of the galaxies were really observable.
We need a new target list.

Notes for 05/29/2019:

SDSS data is not designed for PCA. That is what I learned 
this weekend. As such, my project is going very slowly, 
and I may just have to give up and write about what I have. 
The main issues are redshift and the high variability of 
stellar spectra.

The SDSS survey lab, however, is going quite well. After 
spending so much time doing this kind of stuff for my project, 
this is a piece of cake.

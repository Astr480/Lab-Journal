Notes for 03/10/2019:

Tom and I have some work to do. Our observability
for the objects we drew from SIMBAD was terrible,
so we need new objects. After some fiddling around,
we found we could just add some AND qualifiers to
the SQL script we used to pull from SIMBAD to 
constrain the declinations of our objects to
be similar to the latitude of the Dominion 
Astrophysical Observatory.

Running the script with this new data produced 
excellent results: The typical object was 
observable for 18 hours using extremely strict 
constraints. This included constraining the moon
illumination to be very low, and the moon 
separation to be very high.

Adjusting the time window to simulate getting rained 
out to one month later had less stellar results. In 
this time frame, the objects were only typically 
observable for 6 hours. This is still good enough to 
get a couple objects, at least!

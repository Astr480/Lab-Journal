Notes for 05/08/2019:

Today we imported data from APO using sftp. We will 
be analyzing this data for the next week. This was a 
tad difficult for silly reasons including misspellings, 
forgetting regular expressions, and failing to transfer 
files between my VM and the Windows system it is 
running on.

Thereis good news, however. I was able to get the data 
and I found SAO DS9 in the standard Ubuntu repositories, 
so transfering the data to my Windows system is no 
longer necessary.

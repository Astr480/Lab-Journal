Notes for 06/07/2019:

I salvaged my laptop! My data drive had failed, becoming 
unreadable. The master boot record was on that drive - 
for some godforsaken reason - so its failure also prevented 
me from booting. The solution: remove the drive and reinstall 
Windows on my boot drive again.

As for the final project. I spoke with Prof. Tuttle, and it was 
agreed that I would have an extra week to finish it. I'm excited 
for the opportunity to finish my work, and I plan on working on 
it like a full-time job.

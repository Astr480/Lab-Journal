Notes for 04/19/2019:

We talked about general observing today. Starting with 
the life of a photon was a good idea, and I may steal it 
for my ASTR 101 tutoring this quarter. It was rather 
surprising to hear that telescope properties are 
dependant upon the facing of the telescope, but it makes 
sense.

Project proposals were due today, and I'm feeling pretty 
good about it. I'll need to work on the FITS assignment at 
home, which is not ideal, but it gives me the 
opportunity to try using AstroPy. I've heard that the 
second part of the assignment might be easier with it.

This is going to be a long weekend.

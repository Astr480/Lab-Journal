Notes for 05/17/2019:

CCDProc is a pain. After six hours of work at home, 
I still have not finished the data reduction lab. I 
honestly think that parts of it would be more easily 
done using raw NumPy arrays. The due date for this 
lab was moved to next friday.

On the bright side, I have modified the scope of my 
project a bit. It turns out that automated star 
classification is a nightmare... something to do with 
arbitrarily giving discrete classifications to a 
continuous distribution of objects. Instead, I will 
now be making a star/galaxy/quasar differentiator.
The source of the datawill be the same, and I will 
query the object in rough proportion to what one 
would expect for a random sampling of bright spots in 
the sky.

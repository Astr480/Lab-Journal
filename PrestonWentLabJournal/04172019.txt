Notes for 04/17/2019:

First thing's first: I've been mislabeling all of my 
notes as being in March, not April.

Today, we started working with FITS files in SAO's 
DS9. Attempting to start the program on my Ubuntu VM 
immediately killed it, and I had to revert to a 
snapshot. Good thing I take one every day.

Otherwise, DS9 seems useful, but complicated almost 
beyond being so. I may try using AstroPy in the 
future.

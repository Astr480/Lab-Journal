Notes for 05/31/2019:

Today was spent on the SDSS Survey Data lab. I worked until 
forced to leave by other responsibilities, and did not quite 
finish. The takeaway: even relatively simple data manipulation 
can take a lot of time. I was excited to get a database crossmatch 
working. I may even use this in some of my summer projects.

Note to self for the future: Just use pandas.

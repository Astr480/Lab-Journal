Notes for 05/20/2019:

Today we peer reviewed our project drafts. Mine 
is quite incomplete (to be resolved this weekend), 
so it was mostly a review of methodology and format. 
It generally turned out good, though I need to 
terminology more.

The papers I reviewed were okay, though one had a 
substantial methodology issue. I informed the author, 
and they have since changed their plans.

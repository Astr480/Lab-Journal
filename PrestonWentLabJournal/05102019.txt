Notes for 05/10/2019:

Today we talked a bit more about instrumental effects 
in observing, then were set loose to work on our 
various projects. I am more comfortable working on 
data analysis from home - where I can take periodic 
music and snack breaks - so I left early.

My plan right now is to dedicate an entire day this 
weekend to this class. Several of my other commitments 
were canceled, so I believe this is reasonable.

Wish me luck.

Notes from 03/01/2019:

Today we configured our work environments. I
left my computer at home, and so was left trying
to get ChromeOS working as a development
environment. This should be avoided however
possible in the future.

After getting home I spun up a Manjaro VM in
VirtualBox. It seems to work fairly well, though
the Guest Additions for VirtualBox were obnoxious
to install. It may be easier to just use Ubuntu in
the future.

Notes for 05/24/2019:

Todat we received a new lab on downloading and 
manipulating data from SDSS and other databases. 
This will help my project, and I will work on them 
concurrently.

We also finished up the photometry lab today. PSF 
photometry in particular, but the photutils 
documentation proved very useful in figuring it out. 
Should I ever have to do this again in the future, I 
will return there.

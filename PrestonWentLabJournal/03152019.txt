Notes for 03/15/2019:

Today we discussed our projects and worked on selecting them. I
had already thought about what I want to do, and decided to make
a star classifier. There are a few papers describing similar 
projects. I saved them to my bookmarks for later reading. 
Skimming them suggests that the project is not only feasible, 
but also incredibly effective.

Techniques others have used include principle component analysis
(naturally), various types of artificial neural networks, and a 
number of clustering methods. The literature does not mention a 
few more modern, effective clustering algorithms (like HDBSCAN) 
so I may test those to make an original contribution.

All in all, things are looking promising.

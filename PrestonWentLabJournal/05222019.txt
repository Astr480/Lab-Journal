Notes for 05/22/2019:

Today was a work day for the photometry lab. I 
completed the aperture photometry section, though 
I do not know if my way of comparing different 
photometric measurements is particularly useful. 
I made histograms showing the flux distribution, 
but this does no provide information about like objects 
across measurements.

I will have to think on this more later.

Notes for 05/06/2019:

Today was a short lecture on CCD data reduction and 
analysis - including signal-to-noise ratio calculation. 
This was useful, and I plan to read the article on it 
that is linked on the course website.

Analysis is proceeding - albeit slowly. I spent much of 
time today assisting my neighbors in debugging their 
code. I know what to expect and how to approach it now - 
it's just the doing of it that remains. I suspect I'll 
tackle it tomorrow, since I have no classes on Tuesday.

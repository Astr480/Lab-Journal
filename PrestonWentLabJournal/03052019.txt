Notes from 03/05/2019:

Today in class we did a basic activity
calculating the ideal observation time for
an object - or we tried, at least. My
Manjaro VM froze and died in the middle
of the class for some reason. I have not been
able to determine the cause. It looks like this
may be one of those classes.

I've spun up a new VM - Ubuntu this time - and now
plan to make use of the VirtualBox snapshotting
feature after every lecture. This way I lose at most
one lecture's worth of work.

Finally, we were introduced to the quarter project!
I want to do something computational, so that I can
present it to potential employers. What interests me
know is using various machine learning techniques to
classify objects. I could pull a large set of objects
from Simbad and throw scikit-learn, Theano, and 
TensorFlow at it! With luck, I can even get GPU
acceleration going - though that may no work well
with a VM.

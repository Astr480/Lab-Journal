Lab Journal: Week 7

5/13/19
- In class we had a lecture on photometry, photutils, PSF, basics of the sky background (such as why it is annoying).
- We chose data to use for the data reduction 
- For the rest of the class we spent some time working on the Data Reduction/Photometry lab.
- I asked Sarah a few questions about the lab, such as how to get the overscan parameters of an image file. 
- I also installed Python 3.6 and photutils.

- I stayed home from school today completely (that sentence feels a bit awkward). I took the time to work hard on all of my schoolwork - 
until Friday, I was completely and utterly swamped in homework (all of my classes had a major assignment due on Friday).
- I read through the Data Reduction/Photometry lab again to remind myself of what I must do to complete it, and I continued doing
some preliminary things to prepare for the bulk of the lab (updated many Python packages, opened up relevant files and web pages 
relevant to data reduction/photometry, etc.)

5/17/19
- In class Sarah reminded us that the first draft (super rough draft) of the project paper is due on Monday. 
- She also announced that the Data Reduction/Photometry lab will be due next Friday instead (thank goodness)
- In class we went over what contents (roughly) to include in the first paper draft (due Monday), and how a scientific paper will most likely differ from an
  English literature paper.
- We also went over what sections to include in our final papers, some of which are included below:
	> Introduction (abstract optional)
	> Possibly a background, to help contextualize the work
	> Explanation of approach, theory
	> Data/Analysis
	> Results/Interpretation
	> Conclusion
- Sarah also gave us tips on what to do and not to do in our papers:
	> Some to-do's:
		~ Include references (bibliography, in-line references)
		~ Make sure all included tables/plots are referenced in the text
		~ Make all plots and tables clear, with complete labels
		~ Plots with multiple lines (overplotting) should have legends and be very clear which dataset is which
	> Some to-don'ts (most are technically just opposites of the to-do's):
		~ Plagiarize
		~ Plot too many lines (or too many similar lines on a single plot)
		~ Include a plot with little relevance to the work or simply not mentioned in the text
		~ Think that making plots, tables or figures enormous will reduce the amount of text I must write to reach the paper length requirement 
- The rest of the class period was spent working on various ASTR 480 work - either the project draft or the Data Reduction/Photometry lab.
- I also made this lab journal. I haven't learned my lesson to not put it off until every Friday.

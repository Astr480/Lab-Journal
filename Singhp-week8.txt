Monday

Today we spend the majority of the time 
doing peer review. I offered some feedback
on a paper. I think that I was way too 
worried about the 1st draft. And it seems 
like everyone is at a different place.

Wednesday
Today we all recieved our peer reviewed
drafts back. There were some really helpful
comments on mine and I think I am def gonna
include some more data and analysis in mine.
In class, we just worked on our projects or 
the lab due on Friday.

Friday

Worked on the lab, on the PSF part. It was 
extremely confusing for me, the documentation 
only helped a little bit. Most of the lab was 
done so I guess its alright.
